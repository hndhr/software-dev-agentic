Next.js 15 App Router · React 19 · Clean Architecture

## Architecture

Module structure and path conventions: `.claude/reference/`

## Principles

Clean Architecture · DRY · SOLID — apply to all new code.

## Workflow

Use trigger skills as entry points — `/builder-build-feature`, `/auditor-arch-review`, `/detective-debug`, etc.

**Feature work → always start with `/builder-build-feature`, never inline.**

## Agent Spawning Rules

**Explore agent — always Grep-first.** When spawning an Explore agent, include this in the prompt:
> Use Grep for all symbol and pattern discovery before deciding which files to Read. Only Read a file in full after Grep confirms it is the right target. Do not speculatively read large view or component files.

Pass Explore output as a structured path list to the next agent — never raw file contents. This prevents duplicate reads in the receiving agent.

## Stack

Fill in your project's decisions here. Agents read this file every session — once filled, they pick up your choices automatically.

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| Backend type | <!-- local-db (Next.js owns the DB) / remote-api (external API you don't control) --> |
| ORM | <!-- Prisma / Drizzle / Kysely / none --> |
| Auth | <!-- NextAuth / Clerk / Lucia / Better Auth / none --> |
| Styling | <!-- Tailwind+shadcn / Tailwind / Chakra / MUI / CSS Modules --> |
| Testing | <!-- Vitest / Jest --> |
| Deployment | <!-- Vercel / Docker / AWS --> |

## Known Configurations

### Tailwind v4 — Dynamic class scanning

Tailwind v4 uses PostCSS and does **not** scan files outside its default source paths. If dynamically composed class names (e.g. `grid-cols-${n}`) are not appearing in production builds, add an explicit `@source` directive to `src/app/globals.css`:

```css
@source "../../path/to/components/**/*.tsx";
```

Do not discover this through trial-and-error builds. Check `globals.css` for an existing `@source` block before running any build.
