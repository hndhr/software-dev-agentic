> **Android mapping**: StateHolder = MVP Contract interface (`[Feature]Contract.kt`)

Create a Contract interface following `.claude/reference/contract/builder/presentation.md ## MVP Contract section`.

## Steps

1. **Grep** `.claude/reference/contract/builder/presentation.md` for `## MVP Contract`; only **Read** the full file if the section cannot be located
2. **Read** the domain entity and use case to understand what the screen needs to display
3. **Locate** the correct path: `feature_[module]/src/main/java/co/talenta/feature_[module]/presentation/[feature]/`
4. **Create** `[Feature]Contract.kt`

## Contract Pattern

```kotlin
interface FeatureContract {

    interface View : BaseMvpView {
        fun showFeatureItems(items: List<FeatureEntity>)
        fun showError(error: Throwable)
        fun showEmptyState()
    }

    interface Presenter : BaseMvpPresenter<View> {
        fun loadFeatureItems(id: String)
        fun refreshData()
    }
}
```

Rules:
- `View` extends `BaseMvpView` (not `BaseView`)
- `Presenter` extends `BaseMvpPresenter<View>` (not `BasePresenter`)
- View methods are UI commands: show/hide/navigate — no logic
- Presenter methods correspond to user interactions and lifecycle calls
- Name: `[Feature]Contract`

## Output

Confirm file path and list all View methods and Presenter methods declared.
