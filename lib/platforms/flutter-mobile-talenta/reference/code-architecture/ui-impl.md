# UI Layer — Flutter

Platform-specific UI layer patterns. Canonical definitions: `reference/code-architecture/ui-theory.md`.

---

## Dependency Rule <!-- 9 -->

UI depends on Presentation only — never imports Domain or Data directly.

Allowed imports: `Bloc`/`Cubit` types, `State`/`Event` types, `flutter/material.dart` and other Flutter framework primitives.
Forbidden: use case interfaces, repository interfaces, DTOs, mappers, datasources.

---

## Screen <!-- 16 -->

A **Screen** is a `Widget` (`StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget`) bound to a single `Bloc`/`Cubit`. It observes state via `BlocBuilder`/`BlocListener` and dispatches events — it contains no business logic.

**Invariants:**
- Wrapped with `BlocProvider` that resolves the Bloc from `GetIt` or a feature-scoped DI accessor (e.g. `[feature]Dependency<MyBloc>()`) — never `MyBloc()` inline
- `StatefulWidget` is used when screen lifecycle (`initState`, `dispose`) is needed — e.g. to trigger the initial Bloc event on mount
- Observes every `State` variant via `BlocBuilder` — no state variant goes unhandled
- Sends events via `context.read<MyBloc>().add(...)` for every user interaction — never mutates state directly
- Contains no business logic — `if`/`switch` only decides what to render
- No use case calls — all data flows through the Bloc

**When to create:** One Screen widget per route. Created after the Bloc/Cubit contract exists.

---

## Component / Sub-view <!-- 14 -->

A **Component** is a reusable `StatelessWidget` smaller than a full screen.

**Invariants:**
- Stateless by default — receives data via constructor parameters and emits callbacks via `VoidCallback`/typed callbacks
- If stateful, wrapped with a scoped `BlocProvider` — never manages business state inline
- No use case calls — all data passed in from the parent Screen or a scoped Bloc
- Reuse check required before creating — search `presentation/common/widgets/` and shared packages first

**When to create:** When a UI element appears in ≥2 screens, or when a Screen section is complex enough to isolate for readability.

---

## Navigator / Coordinator <!-- 14 -->

A **Navigator** is GoRouter's `AppRouter` singleton that owns all navigation logic for the app or feature.

**Invariants:**
- The Screen delegates navigation intent via `BlocListener` — it never hard-codes a destination in a button handler
- The Bloc emits a `NavAction` field in `State` — the Screen's `BlocListener` calls `context.go/push`
- Route constants defined in `Routes` class — the Screen never constructs path strings inline
- One `AppRouter` per app (or per module in modular setups) — not per screen

**When to create:** When a Screen navigates to another screen. `Routes` constants and `AppRouter` created before the Screen that triggers navigation. See `navigation-impl.md` for full GoRouter pattern.

---

## DI Wiring <!-- 13 -->

**DI wiring** registers the `Bloc`/`Cubit` in the `GetIt` container via `injectable`.

**Invariants:**
- Bloc annotated `@injectable` (or `@lazySingleton` for shared state) — scope matches feature lifetime
- Use cases injected into the Bloc constructor — never instantiated inside the Bloc
- `BlocProvider` in Screen resolves via `getIt<MyBloc>()` or a feature-scoped accessor `[feature]Dependency<MyBloc>()` — never constructed inline

**When to create:** After the Screen and Bloc exist. Required before the route is reachable.

---

## Creation Order <!-- 10 -->

```
Screen widget → AppRouter route entry + Routes constant (if navigation needed) → GetIt registration
```

The `Bloc`/`Cubit` and its contract must exist before any UI layer file is written.

---

## Layer Invariants <!-- 10 -->

- Screen never mutates state directly — observes via `BlocBuilder`/`BlocConsumer` only
- Screen never calls use cases directly — all interactions dispatched as Bloc events
- Bloc instantiated via GetIt — never `MyBloc()` inline in a widget tree
- Navigation delegated to GoRouter via `BlocListener` — Screen emits nav action, not destination
- No data layer knowledge — no DTOs, no datasources, no HTTP types visible in widget files

---

## Planner Search Patterns <!-- 7 -->

When exploring the UI layer, glob for:
- `**/presentation/screens/**/*_screen.dart` — screen files
- `**/presentation/common/widgets/**/*.dart` — shared component files
- `**/presentation/navigation/app_router.dart` — router configuration
- `**/presentation/navigation/routes.dart` — route constants

---

## Design System Bindings <!-- 22 -->

MekariPixel (`mekari_pixel`) is the design system for this platform. Agents must prefer MekariPixel components over raw Material/Cupertino widgets.

**Import pattern:**
```dart
import 'package:mekari_pixel/mekari_pixel.dart';
```

**Applying the binding table:**
The `### Design System Bindings` block in the skill prompt maps UI element descriptions to resolved MekariPixel symbols. Use the mapped symbol wherever the description appears in widget code. If no binding exists for an element, fall back to the Material equivalent.

| Common mapping | MekariPixel symbol |
|---|---|
| Primary button | `PxButton` |
| Avatar / profile image | `PxAvatar` |
| List tile | `PxListTile` |
| Text field / input | `PxTextField` |
| Icon | `PxIcon` |

**Collection config:** declare the MekariPixel ChromaDB collection in `.claude/dart-knowledge.yaml` with `kind: design_system` so `builder-pres-resolve-design` can locate it.
