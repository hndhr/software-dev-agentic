## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — optional path to the local ticket `.md` file.

## Step 1 — Resolve Ticket Path

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the ticket path.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, call `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question    : "What is the path to your local ticket file? (e.g. /path/to/TICKET-123.md)"
header      : "Ticket path"
multiSelect : false
options     :
  - label: "Enter path", description: "Provide the absolute path to the ticket .md file"
```

Verify the file exists before continuing. If it does not exist, report the path and stop.

## Step 2 — Load Ticket Content

Read the ticket file at the resolved path. This is the only direct file read this skill performs.

## Step 3 — Detect Scope

Spawn `builder-groom-orchestrator` with mode `detect-scope`:

> **Mode: detect-scope**
>
> **ticket-path:** <resolved absolute path>
>
> **ticket-content:**
> <full content of the ticket file>

Wait for the orchestrator to return a `Decision: spawn-planners` or `Decision: blocked`.

- **`Decision: blocked`** → surface the orchestrator's question to the user via `AskUserQuestion`, then stop or retry based on the answer.
- **`Decision: spawn-planners`** → proceed to Step 4.

## Step 4 — Spawn Planners

Spawn each planner listed in the `Decision: spawn-planners` block **in parallel**, passing each the grooming-mode instruction:

> **Mode: grooming-only**
>
> Do NOT recommend artifacts to create. Do NOT produce plan-ready output. Omit `### Impact Recommendations`.
>
> Your task is discovery only:
> - What artifacts already exist for this feature area?
> - Which layer does this ticket touch?
> - What naming conventions are in use?
> - Are there any ambiguities or gaps — missing interfaces, inconsistent naming, unclear ownership?
>
> Return a short findings block. One finding per bullet — no prose paragraphs.

Also pass to each: feature name (from ticket title), platform (if detectable from ticket), module-path (if detectable).

Wait for all planners to complete.

## Step 5 — Synthesize and Update Ticket

Spawn `builder-groom-orchestrator` with mode `synthesize`:

> **Mode: synthesize**
>
> **ticket-path:** <resolved absolute path>
>
> **Planner Findings:**
> <paste all planner findings blocks>

The orchestrator produces the grooming summary and chains to `tracker-adjust-ticket` to update the ticket.
