## Routing Contract

This skill is a pure router. Its only permitted direct operations:
- `Bash` — preflight existence checks and run-dir persistence writes only
- `Read` — only for explicit `.md` input files passed as formal arguments to this skill
- `WebFetch` — only for non-Figma URLs passed as formal arguments to this skill
- `AskUserQuestion` — approval prompts defined in each step

**Arguments are only what follows `/builder-plan-feature` on the invocation line.** The rest of the user's message (instructions, context, directory hints) is NOT processed by the skill — pass it verbatim to the orchestrator in Step 1. Do not read files, grep, or explore based on anything in the message body.

Never confirm, summarize, or add extra questions between steps. Route directly on the Decision block returned by the orchestrator.

Never read source files, search the codebase, or write code. All exploration, planning, and implementation is exclusively delegated to orchestrator / planner / worker agents.

## Preflight — Detect Existing Runs

```bash
find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/agentic-state/runs" -maxdepth 2 -name "plan.md" 2>/dev/null
find "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/agentic-state/runs" -maxdepth 2 -name "figma-groups.json" 2>/dev/null
```

Collect results as `found_plans` and `found_figma`. **Do not route yet.** Pass them to Step 1 so the orchestrator sees the user's intent alongside any existing runs before making a routing decision.

## Step 0 — Classify Inputs

Parse only the formal arguments passed on the invocation line. The skill only fetches things that require its network tools — local files and directories go to the orchestrator as raw paths.

| Pattern | Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| URL containing `jira` or `atlassian`, or bare ticket ID (e.g. `PROJ-123`) | Jira ticket | Fetch inline via Atlassian MCP → `resolved_inputs` |
| Any other URL (including `figma.com`) | PRD / doc / design | Fetch inline via `WebFetch` → `resolved_inputs` (Figma page URLs) or add to `raw_paths` |
| Local file path or directory path | Local content | Add to `raw_paths` — do not read |

If no arguments are provided, skip this step — proceed to Step 1 with `resolved_inputs = []` and `raw_paths = []`.

Collect:
- `resolved_inputs` — successfully fetched remote items: `{ type, source, content }`
- `raw_paths` — local file and directory paths to hand to the orchestrator
- `failed_inputs` — remote items that could not be fetched: `{ type, source, reason }`

If `failed_inputs` is non-empty, call `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question    : "Some inputs couldn't be fetched: <list each with reason>. What would you like to do?"
header      : "Input Fetch"
multiSelect : false
options     :
  - label: "Continue",         description: "Proceed with the inputs that were successfully resolved"
  - label: "Provide manually", description: "Paste or describe the missing content before continuing"
  - label: "Cancel",           description: "Stop and retry after fixing the inputs"
```

**Continue** → proceed with `resolved_inputs` as-is.  
**Provide manually** → collect content from user, append to `resolved_inputs`. Then proceed.  
**Cancel** → stop.

## Step 1 — Gather Intent

Spawn `builder-feature-orchestrator` with mode `gather-intent`:

> **Mode: gather-intent**
>
> **User message:**
> \<the full user message verbatim — includes any context, directory hints, or instructions the user provided\>
>
> <if found_plans or found_figma is non-empty, include:>
> **Existing runs:**
> \<found_plans list, or "(none)"\>
> **Existing figma groups:**
> \<found_figma list, or "(none)"\>
>
> <if resolved_inputs is non-empty, include:>
> **Resolved Inputs:**
> <for each item: "### <type> — <source>\n<content>">
>
> <if raw_paths is non-empty, include:>
> **Raw Paths:**
> \<list each path — orchestrator should read these to extract context and Figma URLs\>
>
> Ask the user for feature intent. Surface any existing runs and let the user choose to continue or start fresh. Return a Decision block when done.

Wait for the orchestrator to return. Route based on the Decision block:

- **`Decision: discard-partial`** → `rm -rf "<run_dir from decision>"`. Re-spawn orchestrator in `gather-intent` mode (same inputs, minus the discarded path from `found_plans`/`found_figma`).
- **`Decision: resume-as-is`** → extract `run_dir`. Proceed directly to Step 5 (Execute).
- **`Decision: spawn-planners`** → extract `feature`, `platform`, `module_path`, `run_dir`. If `update_mode: true` also extract `completed_artifacts`, `open_questions`, `figma_groups`. Extract `pending_figma_urls` (may be empty). Initialize `visited = []`, `all_findings = []`, `round = 1`. Proceed to Step 1.5 (if `pending_figma_urls` non-empty) or Step 2.

## Step 1.5 — Fetch Figma Inputs (skip if `pending_figma_urls` is empty)

`run_dir` is already known from the `Decision: spawn-planners` block — use it directly.

Spawn one `builder-figma-worker` per URL in `pending_figma_urls` — pass `figma_url`, `feature`, and `run_dir`. **Spawn all workers in parallel** (single Agent tool call).

Collect results from all workers:
- `figma_resolved` — workers that returned `## Figma Worker Output` blocks
- `figma_sections` — workers that returned `## Figma Section Detected` blocks
- `figma_failed` — failed fetches: `{ source, reason }`

**If `figma_sections` is non-empty** — expand each section into individual frame workers. For each section, spawn one `builder-figma-worker` per child frame **in parallel** (single Agent call across all children of all sections) — pass `figma_url` constructed as `https://www.figma.com/design/<fileKey>?node-id=<child_id>`, same `feature` and `run_dir`. Collect results and merge into `figma_resolved` and `figma_failed`.

If `figma_failed` is non-empty, call `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question    : "Some Figma frames couldn't be fetched: <list each with reason>. What would you like to do?"
header      : "Figma Fetch"
multiSelect : false
options     :
  - label: "Continue",  description: "Proceed with the frames that were successfully fetched"
  - label: "Cancel",    description: "Stop and retry after fixing the Figma inputs"
```

### Step 1.5b — Verify Figma Grouping (skip if `figma_resolved` is empty)

Spawn `builder-figma-worker` with mode `group-frames`:

> mode: group-frames
> run_dir: \<run_dir\>

Wait for the `## Figma Groups` output block. Extract `groups` as `figma_groups` and `review` (may be absent).

Build the grouping summary:
```
<for each group:>
• <screen> — states: <comma-separated state names>
<if review present:>

Needs your eye:
<for each review entry:>
• <frame>: <reason>
```

Call `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question    : "Figma frames grouped into screens. Does this look correct?

               <grouping summary>"
header      : "Figma Screens"
multiSelect : false
options     :
  - label: "Correct",  description: "Grouping looks right — proceed to planning"
  - label: "Adjust",   description: "The grouping needs changes before we continue"
```

**Correct** → store `figma_groups` and proceed.

**Adjust** → ask the user to describe corrections (which frames belong to which screen, any renames). Apply to `figma_groups`. Then proceed.

`figma_groups` structure carried forward:
```
[
  {
    screen: "<parent_frame>",
    states: [
      { state: "<state>", file: "<abs-path-to-.md>", layout_file: "<abs-path-to--layout.jsx>", screenshot: "<url>" },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

**Persist figma_groups to disk** — write immediately after grouping is confirmed:

```bash
cat > "<run_dir>/figma-groups.json" << 'EOF'
<figma_groups as JSON>
EOF
```

Initialize:
- `visited` = [] (empty set of explored layers)
- `all_findings` = [] (accumulated planner findings across all rounds)
- `round` = 1

Proceed to Step 2. Do not read widget files, grep the codebase, or write any code — all exploration, planning, and implementation is done by planners and workers.

## Step 2 — Planning Convergence Loop

Repeat until the orchestrator returns `Decision: converged` or `Decision: blocked`.

### 2a — Spawn planners for this round

From the current `Decision: spawn-planners` block, read the `spawn:` list. Spawn each listed planner **in parallel** (single Agent tool call with all planners in that round):

- `builder-domain-planner` — if `domain` is in the spawn list
- `builder-data-planner` — if `data` is in the spawn list
- `builder-pres-planner` — if `pres` is in the spawn list
- `builder-app-planner` — if `app` is in the spawn list

Pass to each planner: feature name, platform, module-path (from orchestrator's gather-intent or review-resume output).

**If `update_mode` is true** (resume path with new intent), also pass:
- `open_questions` — the user's stated issues from the Decision block, verbatim. Planners use these to focus on what needs fixing rather than doing a full greenfield sweep.
- `completed_artifacts` — list of already-built artifact names. Planners treat these as locked: report `exists` status, do not propose recreating them.

For `builder-pres-planner` specifically — if `figma_groups` was established in Step 1.5b or Step R0, also pass:
- The full `figma_groups` structure (screen → states + file paths) — do NOT inline file contents

Wait for all planners in this round to complete.

Add each spawned layer to `visited`. Append each planner's full findings block to `all_findings`.

**Persist findings to disk** — write after every round completes:

```bash
cat > "<run_dir>/findings-round-<N>.json" << 'EOF'
{
  "round": <N>,
  "visited": [<visited list>],
  "findings": "<all_findings for this round, escaped>"
}
EOF
```

### 2b — Send findings to orchestrator

Spawn `builder-feature-orchestrator` with mode `process-findings`:

> **Mode: process-findings**
>
> Round: <N>
> Visited layers: <comma-separated list from visited set>
>
> **Accumulated Findings:**
> <paste full all_findings content>

Wait for the orchestrator's decision block.

- **`Decision: spawn-planners`** → increment `round`, go back to 2a
- **`Decision: converged`** → proceed to Step 3
- **`Decision: blocked`** → present the orchestrator's question to the user via `AskUserQuestion`, send the answer back to orchestrator as a follow-up `process-findings` call, then re-evaluate

**Max rounds guard:** If `round` reaches 4 without convergence, stop the loop and surface to the user:
> "Planning could not converge after 3 rounds. Open questions: <list from last blocked decision>. Please clarify before retrying."

## Step 3 — Synthesize Plan

**If `update_mode` is true** — archive the current plan before synthesizing:

```bash
N=$(ls "<run_dir>/plan-v"*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
N=$((N + 1))
mv "<run_dir>/plan.md"    "<run_dir>/plan-v${N}.md"
mv "<run_dir>/context.md" "<run_dir>/context-v${N}.md"
```

Spawn `builder-feature-orchestrator` with mode `synthesize`:

> **Mode: synthesize**
>
> \<if update_mode is true:\>
> **update: true**
>
> **existing_plan:**
> \<content of archived plan-vN.md\>
>
> **existing_context:**
> \<content of archived context-vN.md\>
>
> **completed_artifacts:** \<comma-separated list\>
> \<end if\>
>
> **All Accumulated Findings:**
> \<paste full all_findings content\>

Wait for the orchestrator to return the plan summary and write plan.md + context.md.

## Step 4 — Approve

Call `AskUserQuestion` immediately after synthesis — do NOT describe choices in prose:

```
question    : "What would you like to do with this plan?"
header      : "Plan"
multiSelect : false
options     :
  - label: "Approve",      description: "Execute this plan with builder-feature-worker"
  - label: "Discuss more", description: "I have questions or changes before this plan is finalized"
  - label: "Discard",      description: "Cancel and delete this plan"
```

**Approve** → proceed to Step 5.

**Discuss more** → address the engineer's questions inline. If the plan itself needs revision, re-run Step 3 (re-synthesize) with the updated requirements added to the findings context. Then call `AskUserQuestion` again with the same three options.

**Discard** → delete the most recent run directory:

```bash
rm -rf "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/agentic-state/runs/<feature>"
```

Stop.

## Step 5 — Execute

Update `status` in `plan.md` frontmatter from `pending` to `approved`.

### Phase 1 — Domain / Data / Presentation / App

Read `plan.md` and `context.md` from the run directory. Spawn `builder-feature-worker`:

> Approved plan ready. Pre-loaded context below — do not re-read plan.md, context.md, or state.json.
>
> **plan.md**
> \<content\>
>
> **context.md**
> \<content\>
>
> Proceed directly to the first pending artifact.

**Checkpoint loop:** if the worker returns `## Context Checkpoint` instead of `## Layers Complete`, immediately re-spawn a fresh `builder-feature-worker` without user interaction:

> Resuming from context checkpoint. Pre-loaded context below — do not re-read plan.md, context.md, or state.json.
>
> **plan.md**
> \<content — re-read from disk\>
>
> **context.md**
> \<content — re-read from disk\>
>
> **Resume from:** \<next_artifact from checkpoint block\>
> **State file:** \<state_file from checkpoint block\>
>
> Read state.json, skip completed artifacts, proceed directly to next_artifact.

Repeat until the worker returns `## Layers Complete`.

### Phase 2 — UI Layer

Read `state.json` from the run directory. Check `completed_artifacts` against the UI layer rows in plan.md. Count UI artifacts with `status: create` or `status: exists` that are not yet in `completed_artifacts`.

**If zero pending UI artifacts → skip Phase 2 entirely and proceed to Step 6.**

Extract `stateholder_contract` path from state.json. Re-read `plan.md` and `context.md` from disk. Spawn `builder-ui-worker`:

> Pre-loaded context below — do not re-read plan.md, context.md, or state.json.
>
> **plan.md**
> \<content\>
>
> **context.md**
> \<content\>
>
> **Stateholder contract path:** \<stateholder_contract from state.json, or "none" if null\>
>
> \<if ## Figma Alignment section is present in context.md, include — otherwise omit\>
> **Figma Instruction:** For every Screen and Component artifact, before writing any code:
> 1. Look up the artifact in the `## Figma Alignment` table in context.md above to get its Figma Files list
> 2. `Read` each `.md` file — extract components, states, interactions, tokens, annotations
> 3. `Read` each `layout_file` JSX — full file, no truncation
> 4. `Read` each `screenshot` `.png` — mandatory, not optional; visual inspection required before implementing
>
> Proceed directly to the first pending UI artifact.

**Checkpoint loop:** if the worker returns `## Context Checkpoint` instead of `## Feature Complete`, immediately re-spawn a fresh `builder-ui-worker` without user interaction:

> Resuming from context checkpoint. Pre-loaded context below — do not re-read plan.md, context.md, or state.json.
>
> **plan.md**
> \<content — re-read from disk\>
>
> **context.md**
> \<content — re-read from disk\>
>
> **Stateholder contract path:** \<stateholder_contract from state.json\>
>
> **Resume from:** \<next_artifact from checkpoint block\>
> **State file:** \<state_file from checkpoint block\>
>
> \<if ## Figma Alignment section is present in context.md, include — otherwise omit\>
> **Figma Instruction:** (same as above)
>
> Read state.json, skip completed artifacts, proceed directly to next_artifact.

Repeat until the worker returns `## Feature Complete`.

## Step 6 — Unit Tests

Read `state.json` from the run directory. Extract all paths under `domain`, `data`, and `presentation` keys — these are the unit-testable artifacts. Skip `ui` and `app`.

Call `AskUserQuestion` immediately — do NOT describe choices in prose:

```
question    : "Run unit tests for created artifacts?"
header      : "Unit Tests"
multiSelect : false
options     :
  - label: "Yes",  description: "Generate unit tests for all created artifacts via builder-test-worker"
  - label: "Skip", description: "I'll run tests manually later"
```

**Yes** → spawn `builder-test-worker`:

> target: <comma-separated artifact paths from state.json>
> platform: <platform from plan.md frontmatter>

**Skip** → surface the paths as a reminder:

> Tests not generated. Run when ready:
> `/builder-test-worker` — targets: <paths>
