# Domain Layer

Canonical, platform-agnostic definitions for the Domain layer.
Platform syntax and patterns: `reference/contract/builder/domain.md` in each platform directory.

---

## Dependency Rule <!-- 13 -->

Domain is the innermost layer. It imports nothing from outer layers.

```
UI  →  Presentation  →  Data  →  Domain
```

Allowed imports: language primitives and pure functional utilities only.
Forbidden: any framework, UI library, HTTP client, database driver, or data-layer type.

---

## Entities <!-- 15 -->

An **Entity** is a pure data structure representing a business concept.

**Invariants:**
- No framework imports — value types or pure classes only
- No business logic — entities hold data; use cases execute logic
- No serialization annotations — no `@JsonKey`, no `Codable`, no `fromJson`
- Immutable — all properties are read-only; mutation produces a new instance (`copyWith`)
- Represent domain concepts, not API shapes — field names match the business domain, not the JSON payload

**When to create:** When the domain needs a named, typed concept with identified fields (e.g. `Employee`, `LeaveRequest`, `AttendanceRecord`).

---

## Repository Interfaces <!-- 15 -->

A **Repository** is a contract that defines data access operations — *what* is needed, not *how* it is done.

**Invariants:**
- Lives in Domain as an interface/protocol/abstract class only — implementation lives in Data
- Returns domain Entities — never raw DTOs, API response types, or database records
- Method names follow the operation's intent: `get*`, `create*`, `update*`, `delete*`, `submit*`
- Parameters are domain objects — not raw dictionaries, JSON maps, or HTTP types
- Error type is the domain error type — never a networking or transport error

**When to create:** One repository per aggregate root or feature domain. Created before use cases — use cases depend on the repository interface.

---

## Use Cases <!-- 35 -->

A **UseCase** encapsulates a single business operation: one class, one public method, one responsibility.

**Invariants:**
- One business operation per class — never combine unrelated operations
- Depends only on repository interfaces — never on repository implementations or data-layer types
- No framework dependencies — no HTTP clients, no UI types
- Accepts typed input (Params/Request struct) — never raw dictionaries or loose primitives
- Returns domain entities or primitives — never DTOs or view models
- All I/O goes through the repository — use cases never call APIs or databases directly

**Mandatory call flow — no exceptions:**
```
Presentation → UseCase → Repository    ✅
Presentation → Repository              ❌  direct call is a CLEAN violation
```

**When to create:** One use case per business operation (e.g. `GetEmployeeUseCase`, `SubmitLeaveRequestUseCase`, `ApproveLeaveRequestUseCase`). Even thin pass-through use cases are mandatory — they preserve a stable indirection point for future validation, caching, or logging without touching the presentation layer.

**Naming:** `[Verb][Feature]UseCase` — verb names the business operation, not the HTTP method.

**Params pattern by operation:**

| Operation | Params structure |
|-----------|-----------------|
| GET (single) | `id` or typed identifier |
| GET (list) | `{ page, limit, filters... }` |
| POST | `{ payload: { fields... } }` |
| PUT | `{ id, payload: { fields... } }` |
| DELETE | `id` |
| No input | platform `NoParams` / `Void` equivalent |

---

## Domain Services <!-- 23 -->

A **Domain Service** contains pure business logic that spans multiple entities or is reused across multiple use cases.

**Invariants:**
- No I/O — no async, no network, no database, no file system
- No side effects — pure functions; same input always produces the same output
- No framework imports
- Returns structured data — never formatted strings, CSS classes, or display labels (presentation formats output)

**When to extract to a service:**

| Scenario | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| 1–3 line condition | Keep inline in use case |
| Complex multi-step validation | Extract to service |
| Logic reused across ≥ 2 use cases | Extract to service |
| Needs independent unit testing | Extract to service |

**Naming:** `[Feature][Noun]` — e.g. `LeaveBalanceCalculator`, `AttendanceScheduleResolver`

---

## Domain Errors <!-- 11 -->

A **Domain Error** is the unified error type returned from all repository and use case operations. It decouples the domain from transport-layer error types (HTTP status codes, network errors).

**Invariants:**
- Domain operations return a Result/Either typed with the domain error — they never propagate raw network errors upward
- Repositories map transport errors to domain errors before returning
- Error codes are business-meaningful (`notFound`, `validationFailed`, `unauthorized`) — not HTTP status codes

---

## Creation Order <!-- 9 -->

When building a new feature's domain layer:

```
Entity → Repository Interface → Use Case(s) → Domain Service (only if needed)
```

Never create a use case before the repository interface it depends on.
