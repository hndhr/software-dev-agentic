## Summary Scores

| Dimension | Score | Rating | Key Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 · Orchestration Quality | 8/10 | Good | feature-orchestrator correctly received path+intent only; Explore used appropriately for read-only scan |
| D2 · Worker Invocation | 7/10 | Good | feature-orchestrator correctly used for ViewModel+test edits; Explore used for dead-code analysis — appropriate types |
| D3 · Skill Execution | 5/10 | Fair | No domain/data/pres skills called; flag-removal work done entirely via direct orchestrator prompt without skills |
| D4 · Token Efficiency | 7/10 | Good | 95.9% cache hit ratio is excellent; read:grep ratio ~6 borderline; Explore subagent consumed 60% of total tokens |
| D5 · Routing Accuracy | 8/10 | Good | Branch prefix `feat/` matches cleanup/chore work — acceptable; feature-orchestrator used correctly once hook fired |
| D6 · Workflow Compliance | 9/10 | Excellent | Hook fired and agent stopped to ask user as required by CLAUDE.md; specific file git adds; feature branch used |
| D7 · One-Shot Rate | 8/10 | Good | 1 rejected Edit (hook), then immediately corrected; no rework of changes after orchestrator ran |
| **Overall** | **7.4/10** | **Good** | |

## Token Breakdown

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Input tokens | 58 |
| Cache creation | 62,142 |
| Cache reads | 1,450,100 |
| Output tokens | 12,158 |
| **Billed approx** | **~1,524,458 token-equivalents** |
| Cache hit ratio | 95.9% |
| Avg billed / turn | ~41,201 |

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Calls |
|---|---|
| Grep | 2 |
| Read | 12 (main session) + 70 (Explore subagent) + 18 (feature-orchestrator) = 100 |
| Edit | 1 (blocked by hook) |
| Agent | 2 (feature-orchestrator, Explore) |
| Bash | ~18 (git operations, file deletion, ls, cp) |
| Glob | 2 |

Read:Grep ratio: ~6 (target < 3 — borderline; large number of reads driven by Explore subagent's exhaustive file scan of 70 Swift files)

## Agent & Skill Invocations

| Component | Args / Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Agent: feature-orchestrator | Remove isEnableLiveAttendanceIpAddress feature flag — detailed file-by-file instructions with exact old/new code | Done — all 9 production sites + 2 test files cleaned in 348s, 40 tool calls |
| Agent: Explore | Find unused files/classes in Talenta/Controllers/Attendance/LiveAttendance | Done — identified 6 unused files across 70 scanned; 770s, 87 tool calls, 122k tokens |

No skills were invoked. The feature-flag removal was handled entirely via a direct feature-orchestrator prompt.

## Findings

### What went well

- The delegation guard hook fired correctly when the agent attempted a direct Edit to a production file, and the agent immediately stopped and asked the user whether to proceed inline or via feature-orchestrator — exactly the behavior required by CLAUDE.md. This is a positive compliance signal.
- feature-orchestrator received intent + specific file locations with exact code snippets to change, rather than raw file contents, which is correct orchestration behavior (P8 compliance).
- Commits were chunked logically into 6 separate commits (flag definition, ViewModels, tests, then 3 dead-file removal commits), each with the TLMN-5139 prefix and Co-Authored-By tag.
- git add commands used specific file paths rather than `-A` or `.`.
- Cache hit ratio of 95.9% is excellent and kept costs low despite the large Explore subagent.
- The initial exploration phase (2 Grep calls + targeted Read calls) was efficient for locating all callsites before editing.

### Issues found

- **[D3]** No skills were invoked for any artifact changes. The ViewModel edits touched presentation-layer code — `pres-update-stateholder` was applicable for each ViewModel that had its flag guard removed. The orchestrator bypassed the skill layer entirely and wrote inline via Edit calls. This is technically correct for a removal task, but the skill layer exists to enforce patterns and would have been appropriate here.

- **[D4]** The Explore subagent consumed ~122,388 tokens (approximately 60% of total session tokens) to analyze 70 files in `LiveAttendance/`. This was a very broad read-heavy scan — 70 Read calls + 5 Grep calls + 11 Bash calls for what ultimately identified 6 unused files. The same analysis could have been accomplished with targeted Grep calls for each class name (~15 Grep calls total) at a fraction of the cost.

- **[D5]** The session started on branch `feature/TLMN-5110_Remove-feature-flag-is_revamp_dashboard-and-its-related-codes` and the user had to rename the branch mid-session to match the actual issue (TLMN-5139). This indicates the work was not pre-planned to the correct issue ticket before the session began — a minor routing misalignment.

- **[D2]** The Explore subagent was spawned for a read-only dead-code analysis, which is correct type selection. However, spawning a full Explore agent (which ran for 12+ minutes) for a task that could have been completed inline with a few targeted Greps represents unnecessary agent overhead for the complexity of the task.

> **Low score on D3?** Run `prompt-debug-worker` with this report + the agent's .md file
> to surface ambiguous instructions that caused this behavior.
> Agent file: `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`

## Recommendations

1. **Use targeted Grep chains instead of Explore agents for class-usage analysis** — spawning an Explore agent with 70 Read calls + file-by-file analysis cost ~$0.51 and 12+ minutes. A targeted inline Grep pattern per class name would achieve the same result in under a minute and under 5k tokens.

2. **Invoke pres-update-stateholder skill per ViewModel** — even for removal tasks, running the skill ensures the agent follows the established checklist (e.g. checks for test updates, ensures no orphaned State fields). The feature-orchestrator should be prompted to use skills for each ViewModel file touched.

3. **Establish branch naming before starting work** — the mid-session branch rename from TLMN-5110 to TLMN-5139 is a workflow friction point. The session should start on the correct branch for the ticket being worked.

## Effort vs Billing

### Token cost breakdown

| Token type | Count | Unit price | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input | 58 | $3.00 / MTok | $0.00 |
| Cache creation | 62,142 | $3.75 / MTok | $0.23 |
| Cache reads | 1,450,100 | $0.30 / MTok | $0.44 |
| Output | 12,158 | $15.00 / MTok | $0.18 |
| **Total** | **~1,524,458 billed-equiv** | | **~$0.85** |

Cache hit ratio of **95.9%** was the primary cost saver — without it, the same session would have cost ~$4.72 at full input rates ($3.87 saved).

### Where the tokens went

| Task | Estimated tokens | % of total | Productive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial flag callsite discovery (2 Grep + summary) | ~25,000 | 12% | ✅ |
| Callsite context reads (6 targeted Read calls) | ~5,000 | 2% | ✅ |
| feature-orchestrator: flag removal across 9 prod files + 2 test files | ~32,681 | 16% | ✅ |
| Commit orchestration (6 chunked commits) | ~3,000 | 1% | ✅ |
| Explore subagent: dead-code analysis of 70 files | ~122,388 | 60% | ⚠️ |
| Perf-review setup (SKILL.md lookup, session copy) | ~10,000 | 5% | ⚠️ |
| Hook-blocked Edit + correction | ~1,000 | 0.5% | ❌ |
| Misc overhead (thinking tokens, permission-mode, snapshots) | ~5,000 | 2.5% | ⚠️ |
| **Total** | **~204,069** | **100%** | |

**Productive work: ~31% (~63,681 tokens / ~$0.26)**
**Wasted on rework: ~0.5% (~1,000 tokens / ~$0.01)**
**Overhead (necessary but non-feature): ~68.5% (~139,388 tokens / ~$0.58)**

### Effort-to-value ratio

| Deliverable | Complexity | Tokens spent | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remove isEnableLiveAttendanceIpAddress from 9 prod files + 2 test files | Medium | ~63,000 | Good — orchestrator completed all 9 sites cleanly in one pass |
| Dead-code identification in LiveAttendance (6 files found) | Low | ~122,388 | Poor — Explore agent used exhaustive file-by-file reads; Grep chains would cost ~5,000 tokens for the same result |
| Chunked commit creation (6 commits) | Low | ~3,000 | Good — clean specific-file adds, correct messages |

### Key insight

The Explore subagent for dead-code analysis was the single highest-cost item at ~122,388 tokens (~60% of all session tokens), costing approximately $0.51 on its own. The task it performed — checking whether 70 Swift classes have any external callers — is fundamentally a grep-per-class-name operation. An inline approach using 70 targeted Grep calls would have consumed under 10,000 tokens and completed in under 2 minutes. The decision to spawn a full Explore agent for this analysis was disproportionate to the task complexity and represents the clearest efficiency opportunity in this session.
