description: Explicit feature-execution entry point — run ONLY when the user directly invokes it with a run_dir or an approved plan/spec document, or when routed from /developer-plan-build-feature, /developer-brainstorming, or /developer-brainstorm-build-feature. Do NOT auto-trigger from general "build"/"implement" requests. Spawns a scope agent to decompose work into batches, executes each batch with parallel workers (feature or ui), then asks whether to generate tests.

## Orchestrator Contract

Only permitted direct operations:
- `Bash` — resolving and validating the input path
- `Read` — reading the plan doc

Never read source files, search the codebase, or write code. Scoping is delegated to the scope agent; implementation to worker agents.

## Step 1 — Resolve Input

`$ARGUMENTS` is a path to a **run directory** or a **plan/spec document**.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, stop:
> No input provided. Pass a run_dir or plan/spec document.

```bash
if [ -d "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then
  ls "$ARGUMENTS/plan.md" 2>/dev/null
elif [ -f "$ARGUMENTS" ]; then
  echo "$ARGUMENTS"
fi
```

- Directory → `plan_doc = $ARGUMENTS/plan.md`, `run_dir = $ARGUMENTS`
- File → `plan_doc = $ARGUMENTS`, `run_dir = dirname($ARGUMENTS)`

If the resolved file does not exist, stop:
> Plan document not found at `<path>`.

Read `plan_doc`.

## Step 2 — Scope & Batch

Spawn an Agent with the following prompt, passing the full contents of `plan_doc`:

> You are a scoping agent. Review the plan/requirements below and decompose the work into execution batches.
>
> Rules:
> - If the steps are small and cohesive, return a single batch.
> - If the steps are large or span distinct layers/concerns, split into multiple batches — each independently executable.
> - Each batch may have multiple workers running in parallel. Worker types:
>   - `feature` — domain, data, pres, or app layer work
>   - `ui` — UI/widget/screen work only
> Return ONLY a YAML block in this exact shape:
>
> ```yaml
> batches:
>   - id: 1
>     description: "<what this batch covers>"
>     workers:
>       - type: feature
>         layer: domain|data|pres|app
>         focus: "<specific work for this worker>"
>       - type: ui
>         layer: ui
>         focus: "<specific work for this worker>"
> ```
>
> Plan doc:
> <plan_doc contents>

Parse the returned `batches` from the YAML block.

## Step 3 — Execute

Process each batch in `id` order.

**For each batch:**

**3a — Spawn all workers in the batch in parallel.** For each entry in `batch.workers`:
- `type: feature` → `developer-feature-worker`
- `type: ui` → `developer-ui-worker`

Prompt each worker:

> run_dir: \<run_dir\>
> batch: \<batch.id\> — \<batch.description\>
> layer: \<worker.layer\>
> focus: \<worker.focus\>

**3b — Checkpoint loop.** If a worker returns `## Context Checkpoint`, re-spawn it immediately with the same prompt. Repeat until it returns `## Layers Complete` (feature-worker) or `## Feature Complete` (ui-worker).

## Step 4 — Tests

Scan `plan_doc` for a test section (e.g. a heading containing "test", "unit test", or a table listing test classes). If one exists, extract the test targets listed there — call this `spec_tests`.

Ask the user:

> Tests are next. What would you like to do?
> 1. Write tests for all implemented files
> 2. Write tests for specific files (I'll tell you which)
> 3. Skip tests

If `spec_tests` is non-empty, add a fourth option before option 3:
> 3. Use the test plan from the spec (`<N>` test targets found)
> 4. Skip tests

- **Option 1** — collect every source file written across all batches and pass them all to `developer-test-worker`.
- **Option 2** — ask the user to list the files, then pass that list to `developer-test-worker`.
- **Option 3 (spec)** — pass `spec_tests` directly to `developer-test-worker`.
- **Skip** — stop here.

Invoke `developer-test-worker` with `target` set to the resolved file path(s).
