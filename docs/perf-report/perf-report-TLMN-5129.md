## Tool Usage

| Tool | Calls |
|---|---|
| Read | 9 |
| Grep | 2 |
| Bash | 11 |
| Agent | 1 |
| Write | 0 |
| Edit | 0 |
| Skill | 0 |

Read:Grep ratio: 4.5 (target < 3 — moderate overage; initial exploration used targeted Grep but analysis phase used direct Read calls on specific files)

## Agent & Skill Invocations

| Component | Args / Description | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Agent: feature-orchestrator | "Remove isEnableLiveTracking feature flag" | Done — 25 files cleaned, 4 commits created |

## Findings

### What went well

- **Correct delegation pattern.** When the user said "ok let's remove it", the orchestrator immediately spawned `feature-orchestrator` rather than attempting inline edits. This exactly follows the CLAUDE.md rule: "Feature work (create or update, any scope) → always delegate to `feature-orchestrator`, never inline."
- **High-quality orchestrator prompt.** The prompt passed to `feature-orchestrator` contained explicit per-file instructions, dead-path semantics, and test cleanup guidance — intent-based, not file-content-based. No raw file contents were embedded.
- **Excellent cache utilisation.** Cache hit ratio of ~93% kept costs very low for the exploration phase, which involved reading several large ViewModels.
- **Correct commit hygiene.** All 4 commits used `git add <specific files>` (never `-A` or `.`), included the `TLMN-5129` prefix, and were logically chunked by layer (flag model → controllers → TM/Dashboard → tests).
- **Thorough upfront analysis.** Before delegating, the orchestrator ran a Grep-first search and then targeted Read calls to understand the exact semantics of each call site (guard-else dead path vs. if-block always-true path). This produced a precise, correct removal brief.
- **Post-execution verification.** After the subagent completed, the orchestrator ran `Grep isEnableLiveTracking **/*.swift` to confirm zero remaining references — a clean completion signal.

### Issues found

- **[D4]** `read_grep_ratio` of 4.5 — the analysis phase (user question "if we removed it since now it's always true…") triggered 7 Read calls to inspect individual call sites. Several of these (`LogOutViewController.swift`, `AccountDisabledViewController.swift`) were read twice at different offsets; a single larger-offset Read or a targeted Grep for the surrounding context would have sufficed.
- **[D7]** One rejected tool call at line 32: `Read` on `Talenta/Module/TalentaTM/Presentation/ViewModel/Dashboard/DashboardViewModel.swift` (wrong path — the file lives under `TalentaDashboard`, not `TalentaTM`). The model self-corrected on the next turn with the correct path, but the wrong path attempt indicates imprecise codebase mental model. The Grep output showed the correct path; reading it more carefully would have avoided this.
- **[D7]** Rate-limit interruption at line 50 mid-session required user `/login` and "continue" prompt. While this is an infrastructure event rather than a model error, it added latency and a user turn.
- **[D6]** No `pickup-issue` or `create-issue` skill was called at session start. The session began directly with exploration. For strict workflow compliance with TLMN-5129, the expected pattern is to call the issue skill first to register the work.
- **[D6]** No PR was created at session end. The commits were made but the session ended without a `gh pr create` call. The CLAUDE.md workflow implies a PR is part of the feature completion loop.

## Recommendations

1. **Add missing DashboardViewModel path to codebase mental model** — The model attempted `TalentaTM/Presentation/ViewModel/Dashboard/DashboardViewModel.swift` when the Grep output had already shown the correct path was `TalentaDashboard/Presentation/ViewModel/DashboardViewModel.swift`. Before Read calls, the orchestrator should re-read the Grep result rather than inferring the path.

2. **Replace multi-Read analysis with targeted Grep** — Instead of 7 separate Read calls to inspect individual `isEnableLiveTracking` usages, a single `Grep --context=5 isEnableLiveTracking **/*.swift` would have delivered the same surrounding context in one tool call, reducing read:grep ratio and saving cache-creation tokens.

3. **Call `pickup-issue` at session start** — The CLAUDE.md workflow expects an issue skill to be invoked before feature work begins. This grounds the session intent in the tracker and enables proper cross-referencing.

4. **Open a PR as part of feature completion** — The session left 4 commits on the branch with no PR. Add a post-commit step to run `gh pr create --title "TLMN-5129 ..." --body "Closes TLMN-5129"` before declaring the task done.

## Effort vs Billing

### Token cost breakdown

| Token type | Count | Unit price | Cost (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Input | 30 | $3.00 / MTok | $0.00 |
| Cache creation | 46,180 | $3.75 / MTok | $0.17 |
| Cache reads | 622,824 | $0.30 / MTok | $0.19 |
| Output | 8,663 | $15.00 / MTok | $0.13 |
| **Outer session total** | **677,697** | | **~$0.49** |
| Subagent (feature-orchestrator) — est. | 96,998 | blended ~$1.00/MTok est. | **~$0.10** |
| **Combined total** | **~774,695** | | **~$0.59** |

Cache hit ratio of **93%** was the primary cost saver. Without caching, the same 622,824 cache-read tokens billed at full input rate ($3.00/MTok) would have added ~$1.87 — making the uncached equivalent ~$2.46, roughly 4x the actual cost.

### Where the tokens went

| Task | Estimated tokens | % of total | Productive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial Grep + caller listing | ~23,000 | 3% | ✅ Productive |
| Impact analysis (7 Read calls + response) | ~115,000 | 15% | ✅ Productive |
| feature-orchestrator spawn + execution | ~400,000 | 52% | ✅ Productive |
| Post-execution Grep verification | ~33,000 | 4% | ✅ Productive |
| Chunked commit creation (4 Bash calls) | ~70,000 | 9% | ✅ Productive |
| Wrong-path Read (rejected) + retry | ~30,000 | 4% | ❌ Rework |
| Rate-limit recovery (login + continue turn) | ~60,000 | 8% | ⚠️ Overhead |
| Perf review invocation (extract-session fail) | ~45,000 | 6% | ⚠️ Overhead |
| **Total** | **~776,000** | **100%** | |

**Productive work: ~83% (~644,000 tokens / ~$0.49)**
**Wasted on rework: ~4% (~30,000 tokens / ~$0.02)**
**Overhead: ~14% (~106,000 tokens / ~$0.08)**

### Effort-to-value ratio

| Deliverable | Complexity | Tokens spent | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full flag removal across 25 files + 8 test files | High | ~400,000 | Good — 75 tool uses by subagent, thorough cross-file edit with no misses |
| Caller impact analysis report | Medium | ~115,000 | Fair — 7 Read calls when 1-2 targeted Greps would have sufficed |
| 4 logical commit chunks | Low | ~70,000 | Good — correct `git add <specific>` pattern, no rework |

### Key insight

The **feature-orchestrator subagent execution** consumed the largest token block (~400K tokens / ~52% of session) but represents the highest-value work: 25 files edited with zero misses verified by post-execution Grep. This is well-proportioned for a flag removal touching 17 production files and 8 test files. The only notable inefficiency was the **impact analysis phase**, which used 7 Read calls instead of 1-2 targeted Greps to inspect the same code; this was a relatively small overhead (~15% of total) but is the clearest optimisation opportunity for future flag-removal sessions. The overall token spend of ~$0.59 for a multi-file cleanup of this scope is efficient.
