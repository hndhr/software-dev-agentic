## Delivery Mechanism

Distribution: **Claude Code Plugin** — two plugins ship from this repo.

| Plugin | Contains | Installed by |
|---|---|---|
| `cipherpol-aegis` | Agents + skills (all personas) | `install-plugin.sh --platform=<id>` |
| `cipherpol-8` | KMS MCP server (ChromaDB + knowledge) | `install-plugin.sh --platform=<id>` |

Plugins are built from `lib/plugins/*/build.sh` via `scripts/build-plugin.sh` and published to the marketplace at `hndhr/software-dev-agentic`. Platform and project IDs are defined in `cipherpol.json`.

`software-dev-agentic` is the single source of truth — agents, skills, and knowledge ship to downstream projects via the installed plugins. For the agent design principles that govern what goes into these files, see [agentic-design-principles.md](agentic/agentic-design-principles.md).

**`lib/` boundary:** Everything under `lib/` bundles into plugins and ships downstream. Everything outside `lib/` is build/repo tooling — never bundled.

**`.claude/` boundary:** `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` are internal tooling for maintaining this repo. They are NOT bundled into downstream plugins.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. All Agents and Skills in `lib/core/`

**Decision:** Agents and skills are organized persona-first. Each persona owns a subdirectory at `lib/core/<persona>/` containing its `agents/`, `skills/`, and optionally `reference/`. Cross-cutting agents and skills (kaku, lucci, perf, cipherpol-status, etc.) live in `lib/core/shared/`. All are platform-agnostic — they contain no platform-specific paths, syntax, or framework references.

Platform awareness is handled at runtime via two mechanisms:
- **KMS** — agents load platform-specific conventions via `kms_list` → `kms_query` scoped to the current platform
- **Runtime platform param** — the calling skill passes `platform` explicitly in every worker spawn prompt

There is no `lib/platforms/` directory. All agents and skills ship to all platform installs via the same `cipherpol-aegis` plugin.

> For the platform-agnosticism rule, see [agentic-design-principles.md — P2](agentic/agentic-design-principles.md#2-agents--brain-decision-maker).

---

### 2. Two-Plugin Split — Agents vs Knowledge

**Decision:** `cipherpol-aegis` and `cipherpol-8` are separate plugins with separate installation and update cycles.

| Plugin | What it is | When to rebuild |
|---|---|---|
| `cipherpol-aegis` | Agents + skills | New agent, skill, or persona |
| `cipherpol-8` | KMS server + ChromaDB | New knowledge source or KMS code change |

**Rationale:** Knowledge updates (seeding new docs into ChromaDB) should not require rebuilding the agents plugin. The two plugins are independently versioned and can be updated separately.

`cipherpol-8` bundles the full KMS Python package and a pre-seeded ChromaDB database. The MCP server starts on demand — no manual server management.

---

### 3. KMS as the Knowledge Layer

**Decision:** Implementation patterns, architectural conventions, and SDLC knowledge live in `kms/knowledge-sources/` and are retrieved by agents via MCP tools — not by grepping flat reference files.

Three tiers in `kms/knowledge-sources/`:

```
universal/              → general principles (SOLID, Clean Architecture, SDLC-wide)
  └─ {discipline}/
       └─ {artifact}/
platform/               → platform implementation conventions
  └─ {platform}/        → flutter | ios | android | web
       └─ {discipline}/
            └─ {artifact}/
projects/               → project-specific deviations only
  └─ {project-name}/
       └─ {artifact}/
```

Agents always query with explicit `platform` and `project` filters. The cascade resolves `project → platform → universal` — agents always get the most specific matching knowledge.

> For KMS design rationale see [kms-design-principles.md](kms/kms-design-principles.md). For path conventions, metadata schema, and retrieval protocol see [kms-conventions.md](kms/kms-conventions.md). For seeding strategy see [kms-seeding.md](kms/kms-seeding.md).

---

### 4. Persona-First Layout in `lib/core/`

**Decision:** Personas are top-level directories under `lib/core/`. Each persona owns its own `agents/`, `skills/`, and optionally `hooks/` and `reference/` subdirs. Cross-cutting components (kaku-worker, lucci-planner, perf-worker, cipherpol-status, etc.) live in `lib/core/shared/`.

Adding a new persona: Create `lib/core/<persona>/agents/` and `lib/core/<persona>/skills/{orchestrators,procedures}/`. The `cipherpol-aegis` build uses `lib/core/*/agents` and `lib/core/*/skills/*/*/` glob patterns — it picks up any new persona automatically with no config change.

---

### 5. `cipherpol.json` — Platform and Project Registry

**Decision:** Platform IDs, KMS IDs, detection markers, and project mappings are defined in a single `cipherpol.json` at the repo root. `install-plugin.sh` reads this file to resolve `--platform` and `--project` args — no hardcoded values in scripts.

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    { "id": "flutter", "kms_id": "flutter", "label": "Flutter / Dart / BLoC", "detection_markers": ["pubspec.yaml"] },
    { "id": "ios-swift", "kms_id": "ios", "label": "iOS / Swift / UIKit" }
  ],
  "projects": [
    { "id": "mobile-talenta", "kms_id": "mobile-talenta", "platform": "flutter" }
  ]
}
```

Adding a new platform or project: add an entry to `cipherpol.json`. No script changes needed.

---

## Convention Compliance System

CipherPol enforces its own conventions through an automated internal review system. This is separate from the downstream code reviewer (`lib/core/auditor/agents/auditor-arch-review-worker.md`) — the internal system reviews *agent and skill files in this repo*, not *application code in downstream projects*.

**Two Distinct Reviewers**

| Reviewer | Location | Audits |
|---|---|---|
| `arch-review-strategist` + `arch-review-worker` | `.claude/agents/` | Agent `.md` files and `SKILL.md` files in this repo — convention compliance |
| `arch-review-worker` | `lib/core/auditor/agents/` | Application code in downstream projects — CLEAN Architecture violations |

> Why separate locations? `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` are this repo's internal tooling — they are NOT bundled into downstream plugins. `lib/core/*/agents/` and `lib/core/*/skills/` ARE bundled. The distinction prevents internal review tooling from polluting downstream project contexts.

**What `arch-check-conventions` enforces:**

| Category | Rules | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Frontmatter | `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools` required; `model: sonnet` for all workers (haiku only for truly mechanical leaf tasks) | 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning |
| Strategists | `agents:` lists only spawned workers; body passes only file paths between phases; writes state file after each phase; no Phase 2 codebase reads; no direct Edit or Write — file changes always through workers; explicit output validation after each spawn — STOP if `## Output` missing or paths don't exist | 🔴 Critical |
| Workers | `## Input` section with required params table and `MISSING INPUT` STOP condition; `## Scope Boundary` section with owned-layer declaration and delegation table; `## Task Assessment` section — skill vs direct edit gate; `## Skill Execution` section — platform path resolution, Read SKILL.md, follow; `## Search Protocol` with decision gate table; `## Output` section with Glob + Grep verification before listing paths; no "Read ... completely" on catalog files (`<name>-catalog.md`) — use `symbol-query` | 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning |
| Core agent platform-agnosticism | No hardcoded platform paths (`src/domain/`, `Talenta/Module/`, `lib/`, `app/`); no platform framework references as rules (`React`, `Next.js`, `RxSwift`, `UIKit`, `BLoC`, `axios`); no platform language syntax as rules (`'use client'`, `readonly`, `BehaviorRelay`); platform knowledge delegated to KMS | 🔴 Critical |
| Skill frontmatter | `name`, `description`, `user-invocable: false` present | 🔴 Critical |
| Reference reads in skills | Catalog files (`<name>-catalog.md`) use `symbol-query` — Grep-first, no "Read completely"; thin format/contract docs (`plan-format.md`, `findings-format.md`, etc.) may be `Read` in full; all referenced paths match actual filenames | 🔴 Critical |
| Fix G | Template files contain only code generation hints — no explanatory/instructional comments | 🟡 Warning |
| Naming | `-strategist.md` / `-worker.md`; skill dirs follow `<layer>-<action>-<target>`; persona assignment correct | 🟢 Info |
| Prompt Clarity | No ambiguous scope; no instructions spanning two CLEAN layers without a stop condition; no contradicting rules; failure paths specified | 🟡 Warning |

**Severity levels:**
- 🔴 Critical — missing required frontmatter, broken reference path, "Read completely" violation on catalog files, platform-specific content in a `lib/core/*/agents/` file
- 🟡 Warning — wrong model, missing Search Protocol/Output, prompt clarity issues
- 🟢 Info — naming deviation, description could be more specific

## "What Goes Where"

| Content | Location |
|---|---|
| Persona agents (strategists, planners, workers) | `lib/core/<persona>/agents/` |
| Cross-cutting utility agents (kaku, lucci, perf) | `lib/core/shared/agents/` |
| Internal tooling agents (not shipped) | `.claude/agents/` |
| Persona skills (Type O / Type P) | `lib/core/<persona>/skills/{orchestrators,procedures}/<skill-name>/` |
| Cross-cutting skills (cipherpol-status, etc.) | `lib/core/shared/skills/{orchestrators,procedures}/<skill-name>/` |
| Internal tooling skills (not shipped) | `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` |
| Architecture + SDLC knowledge | `kms/knowledge-sources/{universal,platform,projects}/` |
| Plugin definitions | `lib/plugins/<plugin-name>/` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | downstream project root |
| `settings.json` | downstream `.claude/` |

> Rule of thumb: is it shipped to downstream projects? → `lib/core/`. Is it knowledge agents query at runtime? → `kms/knowledge-sources/`. Is it tooling for maintaining this repo only? → `.claude/`.

## Setup & Installation

```bash
# Build all plugins
scripts/build-plugin.sh

# Build a specific plugin
scripts/build-plugin.sh --target=cipherpol-aegis
scripts/build-plugin.sh --target=cipherpol-8

# Install into a downstream project
scripts/install-plugin.sh --platform=flutter
scripts/install-plugin.sh --platform=ios-swift --project=talenta-ios

# Test a built plugin locally
claude --plugin-dir dist/plugins/cipherpol-aegis
```

**What `install-plugin.sh` does:**
1. Resolves platform + project from `cipherpol.json`
2. Adds the marketplace (`hndhr/software-dev-agentic`) to global `~/.claude/settings.json` if absent
3. Patches `enabledPlugins` in the project's `.claude/settings.json` for `cipherpol-aegis` and `cipherpol-8`
4. Syncs the managed section in `CLAUDE.md` with platform and project context

**Adopting updates:**
```bash
git pull                                        # pull latest from this repo
scripts/build-plugin.sh                         # rebuild both plugins
scripts/install-plugin.sh --platform=<platform> # reinstall into project
```

---

## Contribution Workflow

1. Engineer identifies a new agent/skill or improvement
2. PR to `software-dev-agentic` with the new/updated file under `lib/core/`
3. Review by peers (same process as any code PR)
4. Merge to main + cut a release (`/release`)
5. Each project adopts: rebuild + reinstall (`build-plugin.sh` → `install-plugin.sh`)
