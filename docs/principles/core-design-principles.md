## What is an Agentic Coding Assistant?

A coding assistant where Claude autonomously routes, decides, and executes — without the user needing to know which tool, command, or workflow to invoke. Trigger skills are the only supported entry path: they own routing, context relay, and spawn prompt construction.

> Skills first. No manual chaining. No context pollution.

---

## Design Goals

1. **Consistent agentics across platforms** — same agents, same principles, one source of truth
2. **Easy to maintain** — update once, all projects get it
3. **Open contribution model** — all engineers can explore, create, and PR new agents/skills
4. **Context efficiency** — no wasted tokens on irrelevant content
5. **Encouraging initiatives** — low barrier to propose new "personas" (orchestrators)

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Skill-First Entry

**Trigger skills are the only supported entry path.** A Type T skill owns the full entry sequence before any agent is spawned: routing (resume vs new run), context pre-loading from the runs directory, and building the spawn prompt with context already inlined. This eliminates cold pre-flight reads, gives the user clear options, and keeps orchestration efficient.

> Not every request needs an agent. If a change is simple and localized (rename a variable, fix a typo, add an import), act directly — the cost of delegation exceeds the task itself.

**Skill-First Entry for Personas:**

Every persona must have exactly one primary entry agent. That agent must have a corresponding Type T trigger skill. The skill is the only supported entry path — direct agent invocation bypasses context loading and is unsupported.

| Role | Has trigger skill? | Spawned by |
|---|---|---|
| Persona entry agent (orchestrator, or single worker if no orchestrator) | Yes — required | User via trigger skill |
| Workers inside a persona | No | Orchestrator only |

The trigger skill owns three responsibilities before spawning the agent:
1. **Routing** — detect existing runs (resume vs new call) and ask the user when ambiguous
2. **Context pre-loading** — read `plan.md`, `context.md`, and `state.json` from the runs directory and inline them into the spawn prompt
3. **Spawn prompt construction** — pass the pre-loaded block so the agent can skip all cold pre-flight file reads

The agent detects the `Pre-loaded context` block in its prompt and jumps directly to the first pending phase. Without it, the agent warns that direct invocation is unsupported.

**Multiple workflow skills per persona are allowed** — as long as they all route through the same primary entry agent. Example: the builder persona has three Type T skills: `builder-build-feature` (direct build or resume), `builder-plan-feature` (planning-first workflow that sequences `feature-planner` → user approval → `feature-orchestrator`), and `build-from-ticket` (non-interactive CI/remote path — fetches a Jira ticket, runs `auto-feature-planner`, then `feature-worker` without any user prompts). All converge on the same executor; the rule guards against direct-invocation bypasses, not workflow variations.

A sub-agent used only as a step inside a workflow skill (e.g. `feature-planner` inside `builder-plan-feature`) does not need its own standalone trigger skill.

> **Adding a new persona:** create the entry agent + its trigger skill together. A persona without a trigger skill is incomplete.

### 2. Agents = Brain (Decision-Maker)

Agents are intelligent specialists, not task executors. Each agent:

- Assesses context before acting (does this file exist? which pattern applies?)
- Decides which procedure to execute
- Handles edge cases and branching logic
- Knows *what* to do and *when*

Agents stay lean — they don't embed step-by-step instructions. That belongs in skills.

**Orchestrators — Multi-Worker Coordinators:**

Orchestrators coordinate multiple worker agents using the `agents` field in frontmatter. Key rules:

- Spawn only relevant workers — never all of them
- Pass file paths between phases, never file contents
- Validate each worker's `## Output` before proceeding — STOP if missing or paths don't exist
- Never read the codebase directly — workers own their own context reads

**Agent Scope — Core vs Platform-specific:**

Agents have a second axis — where they live and what they know.

- **Core** (`lib/core/agents/`) — platform-agnostic. Work on any platform. Add here when the behaviour is identical across all platforms.
- **Platform-specific** (`lib/platforms/<platform>/agents/`) — exist only when the workflow diverges enough from core to need its own agent. Examples: iOS `test-orchestrator` (knows `xcodebuild`), iOS `pr-review-worker` (knows Swift/UIKit conventions). Do not add a platform agent unless a core agent + platform skills cannot handle it.

> For the full agent roster, see [persona-builder.md](persona/builder.md).

**DI at Skill Level:**

Workers are platform-agnostic protocol-definers. Skills are the platform-specific implementations of that protocol. A `domain-worker` calls `domain-create-entity` by name — on iOS that creates a Swift struct, on web a TypeScript interface. The worker never knows which platform it's on and doesn't need to.

**Skills are create-only.** Platform-contract skills cover new artifact creation only (`create-*`). There are no update or fix skills — workers handle modifications to existing artifacts via direct `Read` + `Edit` with reference docs. Workers invoke a skill only when the target artifact does not yet exist.

| Role | Protocol analogy | Platform-aware? |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrators | Interface contract | No |
| Planners | Requirements analysis | No |
| Workers | Use-case logic | No |
| Skills | Concrete implementation | Yes |

**Layer Isolation — Bounded Knowledge and Authority:**

Layer isolation is enforced at the **planner** level, not the worker level. `feature-worker` is a single executor that handles all CLEAN layers sequentially, guided by `plan.md`. The planners are what are layer-bounded:

- Each layer planner (`domain-planner`, `data-planner`, `pres-planner`, `app-planner`) is restricted to read-only tools (`Glob`, `Grep`, `Read`) — it physically cannot write files
- Each planner's glob patterns and instructions scope it to its own layer's directories and artifact types
- Cross-layer knowledge (shared contracts, interfaces) lives in reference docs and skills, not in planner bodies
- `feature-planner` coordinates all four planners in parallel — it never asks one planner to explore another layer's artifacts

`feature-worker` executes all layers in a fixed order (domain → data → presentation → UI) using skills as the platform-specific hands. Layer correctness in the worker comes from following `plan.md` and calling the right skill per artifact type — not from a boundary enforcement mechanism.

**Context Isolation = Efficiency:**

Every agent runs in its own isolated context window — completely separate from the main session. This is the primary mechanism for token efficiency.

From the official docs:
> *"Preserve context by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation"*

When a worker reads reference docs, scans existing files, and writes code — none of that touches your main session context. The main session only sees the result.

| Component | Context cost | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Core agents (descriptions) | ~3–5 lines each in main session | Agent tool definition |
| Platform-specific agents (descriptions) | ~3–5 lines each in main session | Agent tool definition |
| Preloaded skills | Loaded at worker startup only | `skills` field |
| Reference docs | 1 Grep call per section needed | Grep-first in worker body |
| `agents.local/extensions/` | 1 Read call (conditional) | Extension hook in shared agent |
| Dead weight (unselected groups) | Zero | Persona groups not linked if not selected |
| Orchestrator context accumulation | Minimal — file paths only | Workers return paths, not content; state file prevents re-reads |
| Context relay (trigger skills) | Zero pre-flight reads in the spawned agent | Skill reads `plan.md`, `context.md`, and `state.json` from the runs directory on disk, inlines all three into the spawn prompt; orchestrator detects the pre-loaded block and skips pre-flight file reads entirely |

**Context relay pattern:**

When a trigger skill spawns an orchestrator on resume, it reads `plan.md`, `context.md`, and `state.json` from `.claude/agentic-state/runs/<feature>/` and inlines their contents directly into the spawn prompt. The orchestrator receives context on its first token and jumps directly to the next pending phase — it never reads those files itself.

This works in both same-session and new-session resumes — the files are on disk, so the trigger skill always reads them regardless of cache state. The spawned agent pays zero pre-flight read cost in either case. Disk is the authoritative source; the trigger skill is the bridge.

**Fail-Fast Precondition Validation:**

Agents validate preconditions before executing procedures — they never guess or proceed with assumptions.

**Workers check on entry (`## Input`):**
- Are all required spawn parameters present? — return `MISSING INPUT: <param>` immediately if not
- Is the task within this worker's layer scope? — STOP and name the correct worker if not

**Workers check before writing (`## Preconditions`):**
- Does the target file/module NOT exist? (before `create-*` skills — avoid overwriting)
- For direct edits to existing artifacts: confirm the file exists before `Read` + `Edit`
- Are required dependencies available?

**Workers check before returning (`## Output`):**
- Does each created file exist on disk? (`Glob`)
- Does each file contain the expected primary class or function? (`Grep`)
- Only list paths that pass both checks

**Orchestrators check after each worker spawn:**
- Does the worker response contain an `## Output` section?
- Do all listed paths exist on disk?
- If either check fails: STOP — do not proceed to the next phase

When any check fails: return a clear, actionable message — never partially execute or silently continue.

**Agent Memory Governance:**

**What to remember:** Confirmed patterns, module-specific conventions not in reference docs, recurring mistakes, user-confirmed preferences.

**What NOT to remember:** Current task details, anything already in `CLAUDE.md` or `reference/`, unverified single-file observations, git history.

**Hygiene rules:** Keep `MEMORY.md` under 200 lines; use topic files for detailed notes; review and prune stale memories.

**Agent Naming Convention:**

| Type | Suffix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | `-orchestrator` | `builder-feature-orchestrator.md`, `builder-groom-orchestrator.md` |
| Planner | `-planner` | `builder-feature-planner.md`, `builder-domain-planner.md` |
| Worker | `-worker` | `builder-feature-worker.md`, `detective-debug-worker.md` |

Format: `<persona>-<domain>-<role>.md`

Every agent that belongs to a persona must be prefixed with the persona name. This makes the persona assignment explicit from the filename alone and prevents collisions as the agent roster grows.

| Pattern | Example | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `<persona>-<domain>-<role>` | `builder-feature-orchestrator`, `detective-debug-worker` | Agent inside a persona folder (`lib/core/agents/<persona>/`) |
| `<domain>-<role>` | `perf-worker`, `prompt-debug-worker` | Flat agent with no persona yet (`lib/core/agents/`) — prefix added when a persona is assigned |

> The filename now tells you the persona AND the agent type instantly — no need to open the file.

---

### 3. Skills = Hands (Thin Procedures)

Skills are focused, reusable workflow procedures. Each skill:

- Does one thing only
- References architecture docs — never embeds them
- Has no branching logic — agent decides which skill to call

Target: under 30 lines per skill

**Exception — Type U runbook skills:** Type U utility skills that consist entirely of Bash commands, pass/fail checks, and formatted output (e.g. `installer-doctor`, `installer-update`) are exempt from the 30-line limit. The rule exists to prevent skills from embedding logic that belongs in workers. All-Bash runbooks have nothing to extract — splitting them would just re-embed the same Bash in a worker, adding indirection with no benefit. These skills may exceed 30 lines freely.

> Naming: `<layer>-<action>-<target>`. Platform-contract skills use `create-*` for new artifact creation only — there are no `update-*` skills. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Skills are either **core-dependency** (same name on all platforms) or **platform-specific** (one platform only) — see [persona-builder.md](persona/builder.md).

**Trigger skill naming — persona prefix rule:**

Every Type T skill that is the entry point for a persona must be prefixed with the persona name: `<persona>-<action>`. This makes the relationship between skill and persona explicit at a glance and prevents naming collisions as the persona roster grows.

| Pattern | Example | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `<persona>-<action>` | `builder-build-feature`, `detective-debug`, `auditor-arch-review` | Type T trigger skill that enters a persona workflow |
| `<layer>-<action>-<target>` | `domain-create-entity`, `data-create-mapper` | Type A platform-contract skill called by a worker |

> Exception: standalone utility skills with no persona owner (e.g. `release`, `agentic-perf-review`) are named descriptively without a prefix until a persona is assigned.

**Preloading skills:**

Agents load their procedure skills at startup via the `skills` field — full skill content is injected at startup. This gives agents full procedural knowledge without embedding it in their body. Same procedures are reusable across multiple agents. One definition, updated once.

**Token budget guideline:**
- Preload skills the agent needs in >50% of its invocations
- Load on demand (via `Read`) skills needed rarely or only in edge cases
- Monitor total preloaded size — if it exceeds ~500 lines, split the agent or move low-frequency skills to on-demand

**Three consumer modes:**

Downstream projects interact with shared agents, skills, and reference docs in one of three modes:

| Mode | Applies to | Mechanism | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Use** | agents, skills, reference | Shared symlink → submodule file | Works as-is — standard workflow |
| **Extend** | agents only | Shared symlink + `agents.local/extensions/<name>.md` | Add behavior without losing submodule updates |
| **Override** | agents, skills, reference | Real file in `*.local/` | Fundamentally different behavior needed |

Extension files contain only the delta — not a full copy. Updates to the submodule are inherited automatically.

Reference docs are override-only (no extension mechanism) — they are structured with `## Section` headers and line counts that agents Grep by offset. Appending to a reference doc would corrupt those offsets and break the Grep contract.

**Local directories and their scope:**

| Directory | Override | Extend | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agents.local/` | ✓ | ✓ via `extensions/` | Workers check `extensions/<name>.md` at the end of their run |
| `skills.local/` | ✓ | — | Replace the whole skill dir |
| `reference.local/` | ✓ | — | Shadows platform/core reference docs; override-only by design |

> Skills have invocation types (A, T, U) — see [Taxonomy §Skills — By Invocation Type](#skills--by-invocation-type) for the full breakdown and decision rules.

---

### 4. Official Docs Compliance

Every design decision must comply with Claude Code's official documentation.

**Compliance checklist:**
- Skill directories follow `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` convention
- Agent files follow `.claude/agents/<name>.md` convention
- Frontmatter fields use only documented keys
- Memory scopes and permission modes use documented values

Confirmed undocumented field: `agents` — not in the official spec (verified against official docs 2026-05-09). Claude likely treats unknown frontmatter keys as hints. Use with awareness that it may change or be ignored in future versions. Runtime delegation always happens via the `Agent` tool — `agents:` is a static declaration for human and tooling readability, not a guaranteed runtime mechanism.

---

### 5. Convention Enforcement — Self-Auditing Architecture

The agentic system enforces its own conventions through automated review — the same principle applied recursively. Convention compliance tooling audits agent and skill files for structural violations before they reach downstream consumers.

> For the internal reviewer setup, checklist, and severity levels, see [submodule-repo-structure.md — Convention Compliance System](submodule-repo-structure.md#convention-compliance-system).

## Reference

**Three-tier structure:**

| Tier | Location | What goes here |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CLAUDE.md` | Universal rules applying to every task — naming, principles, build command. ~1 page max |
| 2 | Agent body | Decision logic for that agent only — what to do, when to do it |
| 3 | `.claude/reference/` | Shared deep reference — patterns, examples, conventions. Loaded on demand via Grep-first |

> Folder structure for reference docs: see [submodule-repo-structure.md](submodule-repo-structure.md).

**Placement decision rule — reference vs agent body:**

| Put it in reference if… | Keep it in the agent body if… |
|---|---|
| It is a fact true regardless of who reads it | It is an instruction specific to this agent's workflow |
| It is an invariant, contract, or architectural principle | It is a decision: when to run, what to check, what to do on failure |
| Multiple agents need the same knowledge | Only this agent needs it |
| Removing it from the agent would lose shared truth | Removing it from the agent would lose execution behavior |

> One-line test: can you state it as a rule without saying "you"? If yes — reference. If it only makes sense addressed to the agent — agent body.

**Search Protocol (decision gate):**

Before any `Read` call, workers answer: "Do I need the full file, or just a specific symbol/section?"

| What you need | Tool |
|---|---|
| A specific class, function, or type | `Grep` for the name |
| A section of a reference doc | `Grep` for the section heading |
| The full file structure (style-matching a new file) | `Read` — justified |
| Whether a file exists | `Glob` |

Read a full file only when: (a) you need its complete structure to write a new matching file, or (b) Grep returned no results. Check `reference/index.md` first if uncertain which file covers a topic.

> Read:Grep ratio should stay below 3. A ratio above 6 is a P6 violation.

**Authoring rule — section line counts:**

Every `##` section heading in a reference doc must carry a line-count comment: `## Section Name <!-- N -->` where N is the number of lines from this heading to the line before the next `##` heading (or EOF for the last section). This is not cosmetic — agents extract N as the `limit` in `Read(file, offset=heading_line, limit=N)` to read exactly one section without loading the whole file. A missing or non-integer `<!-- N -->` forces a full-file Read.

```markdown
## DTOs <!-- 35 -->        ← correct: integer line count
## Mappers <!-- stub -->   ← wrong: agent cannot extract a limit
## Data Sources            ← wrong: no comment at all
```

`arch-check-conventions` enforces this — a missing integer is a Warning violation.

**Authoring rule — canonical headings (ubiquitous language):**

Every `##` section heading in a cross-platform reference doc is a **grep key** — it is the exact string a generic agent searches for across all platforms. The heading must be identical across all platform files that cover the same concept.

This is *Ubiquitous Language* from Domain-Driven Design applied to agent tooling. One concept = one term = one heading, everywhere. No synonyms at the `##` level. Platform-specific terminology belongs in the body, not the heading.

```markdown
## Repository Interfaces <!-- 31 -->
In Swift, these are declared as protocols...   ← platform dialect lives here

## Repository Protocols <!-- 31 -->            ← wrong: breaks agent grep across platforms
```

| Contract | Axis | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Vertical (line count) | Within one file | `## Section <!-- N -->` — agents extract N as read limit |
| Horizontal (canonical heading) | Across all platforms | Same `##` text for the same concept — agents grep once, find all platforms |

When adding a new section to a platform reference file, check whether the same concept exists in other platforms first. If it does, use that heading exactly. If it's net-new, choose a platform-agnostic term and apply it to all platforms that need it.

---

## Taxonomy

### Persona

A named group of related agents serving a coherent workflow.

Requirements:
- Lives in `lib/core/agents/<persona>/`
- Has at least one worker or orchestrator
- Agents within the group relate to and can depend on each other
- Requires a `.pkg` file for selective installation

Shared to all downstream projects via symlink. Current personas: `builder`, `detective`, `tracker`, `auditor`, `installer`.

> A persona is not just a folder. It represents a coherent workflow. Do not group unrelated agents into a persona subdirectory.

### Agents

#### By Role

| Role | Subordinates | Can write files? | Has `agents` field? | Has `skills` field? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | Planners, other orchestrators, or workers | No — delegates all writes to workers | Yes | Typically no |
| Planner | Layer planners (in parallel) or none | Plan artifacts only (`plan.md`, `context.md`) — never source files | Yes (if spawning sub-planners) | No |
| Worker | Skills via `related_skills` | Yes — source files only | No | Yes — skills injected at startup |

**Planner — role and scope:**

A planner explores the codebase and produces a human-reviewable plan before any source file is written. It is always read-only with respect to source code.

- Reads existing artifacts to assess what exists, what naming conventions are in use, and what key symbols need preserving
- May spawn layer-specialized sub-planners in parallel (e.g. `domain-planner`, `data-planner`, `pres-planner`) to keep each exploration context small and focused
- Writes only `plan.md` and `context.md` to the runs directory — never source files
- Stops and waits for human approval before execution begins

Sub-planners follow the same constraints: read-only, structured findings output, no source writes.

> Orchestrators may spawn other orchestrators when the inner orchestrator represents a fully bounded sub-workflow. The outer orchestrator owns the top-level state file and final report.

#### By Scope

| Scope | Location | Ships downstream? |
|---|---|---|
| **Persona agent** | `lib/core/agents/<persona>/` | Yes — all platforms |
| **Platform agent** | `lib/platforms/<platform>/agents/` | Yes — matching platform only |
| **Project agent** | `.claude/agents.local/` | No — project-owned, not in this repo |

> Persona agents must be platform-agnostic — no platform paths, framework references, or language syntax in the body (Critical per P6).

### Skills

#### By Invocation Type

| Type | Config | Who triggers | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Regular** | `user-invocable: false` | Worker (agent) only | Standard build/update procedures |
| **T — Trigger** | `user-invocable: true` + uses `Agent` tool | User only | Entry point that spawns an agent workflow |
| **U — Utility** | `user-invocable: true`, no `Agent` tool | User only | Self-contained interactive tool — runs with model, does not spawn agents |

> **Type T vs Type U:** Both are user-invocable and model-run. Type T spawns an agent workflow (`agentic-perf-review` → `perf-worker`). Type U does its own work directly (`doctor`, `clear-runs`, `release`).

> For automated bash execution without model involvement, use hooks in `settings.json` — not a skill.

**Why no Type C (default — both user and agent):** Every default skill's description loads into the main session context on every turn. Types A, T, and U all eliminate this overhead.

#### By Scope

| Scope | Location | Ships downstream? |
|---|---|---|
| **Toolkit skill** | `lib/core/skills/` | Yes — all platforms. Platform-agnostic, intended for use in downstream projects. |
| **Platform-contract skill** | `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/contract/` | Yes — matching platform. Same name across all platforms; each implements for its syntax — called by persona workers. Lands flat in `.claude/skills/<name>/` downstream. |
| **Platform-only skill** | `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/` (flat) | Yes — matching platform only. Called by platform agents. |
| **Project skill** | `.claude/skills.local/` | No — project-owned, not in this repo. |
| **Repo skill** | `.claude/skills/` | No — internal tooling only. Used by this repo's internal agents; never symlinked to downstream projects. |

> "Core-dependency skill" used in earlier sections of this doc refers to platform-contract skills — skills all platforms must implement under the same name (`domain-create-entity`, `data-create-mapper`, etc.).

#### Valid Type × Scope Combinations

Not all combinations are meaningful. Use this as the decision gate when adding a new skill:

| Scope | A — Regular | T — Trigger | U — Utility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Toolkit | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Platform-contract | ✓ | — | — |
| Platform-only | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Project | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Repo | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

> Toolkit skills are always user-facing (Type T or U) — agents don't call them, workers call platform-contract skills instead. Platform-contract skills are always Type A — they're called by workers programmatically, never by users directly.

### Reference Docs

#### By Scope

| Scope | Location | Ships downstream? |
|---|---|---|
| **Core reference** | `lib/core/reference/` | Yes — all platforms. Defines what each concept IS (platform-agnostic). |
| **Platform reference** | `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/` | Yes — matching platform. Defines how each concept is implemented in that platform's syntax. |
| **Project reference** | `.claude/reference.local/` | No — project-owned, not in this repo. Overrides platform/core docs for project-specific conventions. |

## Anatomy

### Anatomy of a Persona

A persona is composed of layered components that connect user intent to executed code. Each layer has a defined role, authority boundary, and handoff contract.

```
User
 │
 ▼
Trigger Skill (Type T)     — routes (resume vs new), pre-loads context, builds spawn prompt
 │
 ▼
Orchestrator               — coordinates phases in order; never writes source files
 │             │
 ▼             ▼
Planner     Planner        — explore only; produce plan.md + context.md; no source writes
               │
               ▼
            Worker         — reads plan, calls skills, writes source files, validates output
               │
               ▼
            Skill(s)       — concrete platform implementation (one per artifact type)
```

Not every persona uses all layers. A simple persona may have only a trigger skill + worker. A complex one adds an orchestrator, planners, and multiple workers. The anatomy is the same regardless of how many layers are present.

**Handoff contracts — what each layer passes to the next:**

| From → To | What is passed | What is never passed |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger Skill → Orchestrator | Pre-loaded context block (`plan.md` + `context.md` + `state.json` inline) | Raw file reads from the main session |
| Orchestrator → Planner | Feature name, platform, runs directory path | Source file contents |
| Planner → Orchestrator | `plan.md` + `context.md` written to runs directory | Source file paths or contents |
| Orchestrator → Worker | File path lists from prior phases | File contents |
| Worker → Skill | Artifact name, target path, reference doc path | Cross-layer context |
| Worker → Orchestrator | `## Output` section with Glob+Grep-verified paths | Partial or unverified paths |

**State files — written and read across the lifecycle:**

| File | Written by | Read by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `state.json` | Orchestrator (after each phase) | Trigger skill (resume routing) | Phase completion + `next_phase` pointer |
| `plan.md` | Planner | Worker | Per-artifact execution instructions |
| `context.md` | Planner | Trigger skill (context relay) | Key symbols, conventions, existing artifacts |

> A persona without a trigger skill is incomplete. The trigger skill is the only supported entry path — it owns routing, context relay, and spawn prompt construction.

---

## Decision Rules

| Situation | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| New CLEAN-layer behaviour, same on all platforms | Core worker |
| New orchestration flow, same on all platforms | Core orchestrator |
| New code generation pattern for one platform | Platform-contract skill (same name, platform implements) → `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/contract/` |
| Workflow too platform-specific for any core agent | Platform agent + platform skill → `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/` (flat) |
| Architecture reference knowledge (cross-platform standard) | `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/contract/<persona>/` — grouped by persona; accessible as `.claude/reference/contract/<persona>/<name>.md` downstream |
| Architecture reference knowledge (platform-specific) | `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/` (flat) |

**Planner vs Worker — when to use which:**

| Work profile | Recommended path |
|---|---|
| Contained, well-understood (1–3 artifacts, clear scope, single layer) | Worker directly — overhead of planning exceeds the benefit |
| Cross-layer feature build, multiple artifact types, or uncertain existing state | Planner first → worker — exploration cost is front-loaded, execution is zero-rework |
| Modification to an existing artifact (targeted edit) | Worker directly with context.md Key Symbols if available |
| Large-scale change across many modules or unknown conventions | Planner first — sub-planners explore in parallel, findings aggregated before a single line is written |

> The rule of thumb: if a worker would spend significant time exploring before it can execute, a planner is the better investment. If the scope is clear and bounded, skip the planner and go straight to the worker.

> **Build-directly is a deliberate opt-out, not a default.** It skips all layer isolation guarantees — `feature-worker` makes layer assignment decisions inline with no plan, no human gate, and no tool restriction. The resume routing gate limits the risk: build-directly is only reachable for brand-new features with no prior run. Any feature that was previously planned always resumes against its existing `plan.md` — the worker never re-makes layer decisions that were already validated.

> For execution examples and the current agent roster, see [persona-builder.md](persona/builder.md).

## Why This Architecture

| Goal | How it's achieved |
|---|---|
| Token efficiency | Isolated context; Search Protocol decision gate; Haiku for mechanical workers; file paths only between phases; orchestrator state files prevent mid-run re-reads; context relay — skill reads runs context from disk and inlines into spawn prompt, spawned agent pays zero pre-flight read cost |
| Modular knowledge | Skills preloaded, not embedded |
| Single source of truth | `reference/` Grep-accessed, never duplicated |
| Safe destructive operations | Use hooks in `settings.json` for automated bash execution without model involvement |
| Reusability | Same skill preloaded into multiple workers |
| Maintainability | Update one skill → all workers get the update |
| Multi-platform scalability | Add `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/` — no agent changes |
| Selective installation | Persona `.pkg` files |
| Self-enforcing conventions | Internal arch-reviewer catches violations before downstream consumers |
| Clear distributable boundary | `lib/` = ships downstream; everything outside = internal tooling |
| Agent prompt quality | `prompt-debug-worker` surfaces ambiguous instructions when perf scores flag low D1–D7 |
