## Delivery Mechanism

`software-dev-agentic` is consumed as a git submodule at the project root:

```
/
  software-dev-agentic/      ← submodule (project root, not inside .claude/)
  .claude/
    agents/                  ← symlinks only (core + platform)
    skills/                  ← symlinks only (platform)
    reference/               ← symlinks only (builder + platform)
```

The submodule is the single source of truth — downstream projects get agents, skills, and reference docs via symlinks. For the agent design principles that govern what goes into these files, see [core-design-principles.md](core-design-principles.md).

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. DI at Skill Level — All Workers in Core, Platform Knowledge in Skills

**Decision:** All core workers live in `lib/core/agents/` — fully platform-agnostic. Platform knowledge lives exclusively in skills (`lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/`). Platform-specific agents live in `lib/platforms/<platform>/agents/` only when the agent itself is inherently platform-specific.

> For the DI at Skill Level principle, see [core-design-principles.md — P2](core-design-principles.md#2-agents--brain-decision-maker).

**Core-dependency skills** — called by core workers. Must be implemented by every platform that wants core agent support. Same name across platforms, different syntax per platform. Located in `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/contract/` — at setup time the `contract/` group is transparent and skills land flat in `.claude/skills/<name>/` downstream.

Naming pattern: `<layer>-<action>-<artifact>` (e.g. `<layer>-create-<artifact>`). Skills cover **new artifact creation only** — workers handle modifications to existing artifacts via direct `Read` + `Edit` with reference docs. Every platform must implement the full create-only set under the same names.

**Platform-specific skills** — called by platform agents only. Implemented only by the platform that owns the calling agent.

> **New platform extensibility:** Adding a 4th platform (e.g., React Native, KMP) requires only `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/` + `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/` directories. No changes to any agents in `lib/core/agents/`.

---

### 2. Persona Grouping in `lib/core/agents/`

**Decision:** Agents in `lib/core/agents/` are grouped into persona subdirectories. Each persona represents a coherent workflow — agents within a group relate to and can depend on each other. Ungrouped agents (no peers yet) remain flat at `lib/core/agents/`.

Adding a new persona: Create `lib/core/agents/<persona>/`, add worker(s)/orchestrators, create `packages/<persona>.pkg`. The installer picks it up automatically — no script changes needed.

**Rationale:** Grouping by persona makes the directory self-documenting and enables selective installation. Engineers understand which agents serve their workflow before opening a single file.

---

### 3. Setup-Time Platform Resolution — No `.claude/platform` File

**Decision:** The correct platform skill files are linked at project setup time via the `--platform=` flag. There is no `.claude/platform` file — platform identity is baked into the symlinks themselves. At runtime, orchestrators also pass `platform` explicitly in every worker spawn prompt so workers can resolve skill paths without relying solely on symlink structure.

**Rationale:** With workers being platform-agnostic files in `lib/core/agents/`, and skills being the platform-specific layer, setup-time symlinks wire the right skill implementations into `.claude/skills/`. Workers resolve skills via the symlinked path `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — no runtime platform path construction needed. The runtime platform parameter (`web`/`ios`/`flutter`) is still passed in every spawn prompt for workers that need to reference platform-specific conventions, but skill execution always goes through the downstream symlink.

Three-pass linking priority: `agents.local` > platform > core (first link wins)

**Result:** `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` points to the correct platform skill implementation (from `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/contract/<skill-name>/`). `.claude/agents/<worker-name>.md` points to the single shared core worker. The worker calls the skill by name and gets the right platform implementation automatically.

---

### 4. Reference Docs Split by Scope

**Decision:** Reference docs live in four locations within the submodule:
- `lib/core/reference/README.md` — taxonomy doc: placement rules for reference vs agent body vs skills (agentic use)
- `lib/core/reference/builder/` — two kinds of files, both preserved as `builder/` subdir downstream (`.claude/reference/builder/<name>.md`):
  - **Universal theory** (`layer-contracts.md`, `domain-purity.md`, `di-containers.md`) — cross-cutting CLEAN Architecture principles shared across all layers.
  - **Layer canonical templates** (`domain.md`, and `data.md`, `presentation.md` in progress) — platform-agnostic concept definitions per CLEAN layer. Defines what each artifact IS, its invariants, and when to use it. Workers reference these for concepts; platform `contract/` files implement the same headings in platform syntax.
- `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/contract/builder/` — cross-platform standard patterns with code examples. Same eight filenames on every platform. Preserved as `contract/builder/` subdir downstream (`.claude/reference/contract/builder/<name>.md`). Syntax and platform-specific patterns only — conceptual definitions belong in the corresponding `lib/core/reference/builder/<layer>.md` template. New personas add their own sibling dir (e.g. `contract/detective/`).
- `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/` (flat) — platform-specific patterns unique to that platform (e.g. `ssr.md`, `server-actions.md` for web). Lands flat as `.claude/reference/<name>.md`.

**Rationale:** The split between `builder/` (what X is) and `contract/` (how X looks in this platform) mirrors the DI pattern applied at the knowledge level: workers know the concept from the canonical template; platform contract files provide the implementation. Universal theory files handle cross-cutting principles that no single layer owns.

**Reference subdir rule:** All subdirectories under a reference source dir are preserved downstream. `contract/` and `builder/` both land as-is. Unlike agents and skills (always flat), reference docs maintain their subdir structure because agents reference them by path (e.g. `reference/builder/domain.md`, `reference/contract/builder/domain.md`). Any new subdir added under `lib/core/reference/` or `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/` is automatically preserved.

Every contract file follows a strict heading structure: `#` platform+topic title, `##` canonical sections (agent-greppable keywords), `###` subsections. This makes `grep "^## Keyword"` deterministic across all platforms.

**Grep-first rule (P6 enforcement):** Workers Grep reference files by section keyword before reading in full. If uncertain which file covers a topic, check `reference/index.md` first.

---

### 5. `lib/` Boundary — Distributable vs Internal Content

**Decision:** All content that gets symlinked into downstream projects lives under `lib/`. Internal tooling stays at the repo root.

**Rationale:** The boundary is explicit and self-documenting. `lib/` = the library surface. Everything outside `lib/` is build/repo tooling. Engineers contributing a new agent know exactly which folder it belongs in without needing to know the implicit contract.

---

### 6. Symlink Architecture

**Decision:** `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` contain only symlinks — never real files. Real files live in `agents.local/` and `skills.local/`.

> The setup scripts recurse into persona subdirectories when linking agents — all agents land flat in `.claude/agents/` regardless of their subdir in the submodule.

**Skills vs References — different downstream behavior:**

| Source location | Downstream path | Subdir preserved? |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/contract/<name>/` | `.claude/skills/<name>/` | No — lands flat |
| `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/<name>/` | `.claude/skills/<name>/` | No — already flat |
| `lib/core/reference/builder/<name>.md` | `.claude/reference/builder/<name>.md` | **Yes** — `builder/` preserved |
| `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/contract/builder/<name>.md` | `.claude/reference/contract/builder/<name>.md` | **Yes** — `contract/builder/` preserved |
| `lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/<name>.md` | `.claude/reference/<name>.md` | No — already flat |

Skills land flat because workers resolve via `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — the `contract/` grouping is a source-level convention only. References preserve `contract/` because skill files contain hard-coded paths like `reference/contract/builder/presentation.md`.

---

### 7. Three Modes: Use, Extend, Override

> For the principle, see [core-design-principles.md — P3](core-design-principles.md#3-skills--hands-thin-procedures).

**Agent extension pattern** — every shared agent ends with a standard hook:

```
After completing, check for `.claude/agents.local/extensions/<name>.md` — if it exists, read and follow its additional instructions.
```

Extension files contain only the delta — not a full copy. Updates to the submodule are inherited automatically; extensions just layer on top.

**Override** — create a real file in `agents.local/` (or `skills.local/`) with the same name as a shared agent/skill. The setup script's `link_if_absent` guard skips symlinking the shared version.

## Convention Compliance System

software-dev-agentic enforces its own conventions through an automated internal review system. This is separate from the downstream code reviewer (`lib/core/agents/auditor/arch-review-worker.md`) — the internal system reviews *agent and skill files in this repo*, not *application code in downstream projects*.

**Two Distinct Reviewers**

| Reviewer | Location | Audits |
|---|---|---|
| `arch-review-orchestrator` + `arch-review-worker` | `.claude/agents/` | Agent `.md` files and `SKILL.md` files in this repo — convention compliance |
| `arch-review-worker` | `lib/core/agents/auditor/` | Application code in downstream projects — CLEAN Architecture violations |

> Why separate locations? `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` are this repo's internal tooling — they are NOT symlinked into downstream projects. `lib/core/agents/` and `lib/core/skills/` ARE symlinked. The distinction prevents internal review tooling from polluting downstream project contexts.

**What `arch-check-conventions` enforces:**

| Category | Rules | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Frontmatter | `name`, `description`, `model`, `tools` required; `model: sonnet` for all workers (haiku only for truly mechanical leaf tasks) | 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning |
| Orchestrators | `agents:` lists only spawned workers; body passes only file paths between phases; writes state file after each phase; no Phase 2 codebase reads; no direct Edit or Write — file changes always through workers; explicit output validation after each spawn — STOP if `## Output` missing or paths don't exist | 🔴 Critical |
| Workers | `## Input` section with required params table and `MISSING INPUT` STOP condition; `## Scope Boundary` section with owned-layer declaration and delegation table; `## Task Assessment` section — skill vs direct edit gate; `## Skill Execution` section — platform path resolution, Read SKILL.md, follow; `## Search Protocol` with decision gate table; `## Output` section with Glob + Grep verification before listing paths; `## Extension Point` at end; no "Read ... completely" on reference docs | 🔴 Critical / 🟡 Warning |
| Core agent platform-agnosticism | No hardcoded platform paths (`src/domain/`, `Talenta/Module/`, `lib/`, `app/`); no platform framework references as rules (`React`, `Next.js`, `RxSwift`, `UIKit`, `BLoC`, `axios`); no platform language syntax as rules (`'use client'`, `readonly`, `BehaviorRelay`); platform knowledge delegated to a skill | 🔴 Critical |
| Skill frontmatter | `name`, `description`, `user-invocable: false` present | 🔴 Critical |
| Reference reads in skills | Grep-first; no "Read completely"; all referenced paths match actual filenames | 🔴 Critical |
| Fix G | Template files contain only code generation hints — no explanatory/instructional comments | 🟡 Warning |
| Naming | `-orchestrator.md` / `-worker.md`; skill dirs follow `<layer>-<action>-<target>`; persona assignment correct | 🟢 Info |
| Prompt Clarity | No ambiguous scope ("create the X" without specifying interface vs implementation); no instructions spanning two CLEAN layers without a stop condition; no contradicting rules; failure paths specified. For deeper runtime reasoning analysis, run `prompt-debug-worker`. | 🟡 Warning |

**Severity levels:**
- 🔴 Critical — missing required frontmatter, broken reference path, "Read completely" violation, platform-specific content in a `lib/core/agents/` file
- 🟡 Warning — wrong model, missing Search Protocol/Output/Extension Point, missing `reference/index.md` hint, explanatory template comments, prompt clarity issues
- 🟢 Info — naming deviation, description could be more specific

**Platform-Agnosticism Rule for `lib/core/agents/`**

> Any `lib/core/agents/` file body that contains hardcoded platform paths, framework references (as rules), or language-specific syntax is a Critical violation. Platform knowledge must be delegated to a skill in `related_skills`.

## Folder Design Rationale

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| All workers in `lib/core/agents/` | DI at skill level — platform-agnostic brains |
| Persona subdirectories | Workflow cohesion; selective installation; self-documenting |
| `perf-worker.md` stays flat | No persona peers yet |
| `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` | Internal tooling — not downstream API surface |
| `lib/` boundary | Explicit distributable surface — everything under `lib/` ships, everything outside is tooling |
| `arch-review-worker` platform-agnostic (P6) | Core workers must not embed platform knowledge |
| `setup-worker` in `lib/core/agents/installer/` | Platform-agnostic setup logic; delegates mechanical steps to platform setup skills |

---

## "What Goes Where" Decision Rule

| Content | Location | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Core orchestrators | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/<persona>/` | Platform-agnostic coordination protocol, grouped by persona |
| Core workers | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/<persona>/` | Platform-agnostic CLEAN layer brains, grouped by persona |
| Tracker agents | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/tracker/` | Issue lifecycle management |
| Auditor agents | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/auditor/` | Architecture review — platform-agnostic CLEAN checker; delegates platform rules to skills |
| Installer agents | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/installer/` | Platform-agnostic project setup + onboarding; delegates mechanical steps to platform setup skills |
| Meta/observability agents | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/agents/detective/` | Performance analysis + agent prompt debugging |
| Internal repo tooling | `software-dev-agentic/agents/` | Convention reviewer — NOT symlinked to downstream projects |
| Platform-specific agents (`test-orchestrator`, `pr-review-worker`) | `software-dev-agentic/lib/platforms/<platform>/agents/` | Agent itself is inherently platform-specific |
| Core skills | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/skills/` | Identical across platforms |
| Platform-contract skills | `software-dev-agentic/lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/contract/` | Same name on all platforms, platform-specific implementation; create-only (`create-*`) — no update skills; lands flat in `.claude/skills/<name>/` downstream |
| Platform-only skills | `software-dev-agentic/lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/` (flat) | Called by platform agents only |
| Internal repo skills | `software-dev-agentic/skills/` | Convention checklist, report formatter — NOT symlinked to downstream projects |
| Universal reference docs | `software-dev-agentic/lib/core/reference/builder/` | Language-agnostic CLEAN theory |
| Cross-platform contract reference docs | `software-dev-agentic/lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/contract/<persona>/` | Grouped by persona; preserved as `contract/<persona>/` subdir downstream |
| Platform-specific reference docs | `software-dev-agentic/lib/platforms/<platform>/reference/` (flat) | Platform-unique patterns; lands flat in `.claude/reference/<name>.md` downstream |
| Project-specific agents | `.claude/agents.local/` | Only relevant to one project |
| Agent/skill extensions | `.claude/*/extensions/` | Additive delta, project-scoped |
| Agent memory | `.claude/agent-memory/` | Project-scoped institutional knowledge |
| `CLAUDE.md` | project root | Project-specific universal rules |
| `settings.json` | `.claude/` | Project-specific Claude config |

> Rule of thumb: if it describes CLEAN architecture theory → `lib/core/`. If it's platform implementation details → `lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/`. If it's project-specific quirks → `.claude/agents.local/`. If it only applies to reviewing or maintaining this repo's own files → `.claude/agents/` or `.claude/skills/`.

## Setup & Installation

```bash
software-dev-agentic/scripts/setup-symlinks.sh --platform=web
software-dev-agentic/scripts/setup-symlinks.sh --platform=ios
```

Idempotent — re-running never overwrites existing files (`link_if_absent` guard). All personas are installed; no menu or selection needed.

**What `setup-symlinks.sh` does:**
1. Convert any old-style directory symlinks to real directories
2. Create `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/reference/`, `.claude/agents.local/extensions/`, `.claude/skills.local/extensions/`
3. Pass 1: Link local overrides from `agents.local/` and `skills.local/`
4. Pass 2: Link platform agents, skills, and reference from `lib/platforms/<platform>/`
5. Pass 3: Link core agents, skills, and reference from `lib/core/` (recurse into persona subdirs; skip if name already linked)
6. Make hooks executable
7. Copy `settings-template.json` → `.claude/settings.local.json` if not present
8. Copy or sync managed section in `CLAUDE.md`

> Note: `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` (internal tooling) are NOT linked to downstream projects. Only content under `lib/` is symlinked.

**Adopting Updates (`sync.sh`)**

```bash
software-dev-agentic/scripts/sync.sh --platform=<platform>
```

1. `git pull` inside the submodule
2. Calls `setup-symlinks.sh` — re-links everything, syncs the managed section in `CLAUDE.md`
3. Prints the commit command to lock in the updated submodule pointer

**Post-setup checklist:**
1. Edit `CLAUDE.md` — fill in `[AppName]` and stack placeholders
2. Edit `.claude/settings.local.json` — replace `PROJECT_ROOT` with your project's `.claude/` absolute path
3. `git add .claude/ && git commit -m "chore: wire software-dev-agentic (<version>)"`

---

## Repository Structure

**Per-Project Layout (after `setup-symlinks.sh --platform=ios`)**

```
/
  .claude/
    software-dev-agentic/    ← submodule
    agents/                  ← symlinks: core + ios platform agents
    skills/                  ← symlinks: ios platform skills
    reference/               ← symlinks: builder + ios reference
    agents.local/
      extensions/
    skills.local/
      extensions/
    settings.local.json
