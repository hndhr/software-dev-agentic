## Architecture Convention Review — <scope>

> Reviewed: <date> · Scope: <what was reviewed>

### Summary
<N> critical · <M> warnings · <K> info · <P> files clean

---

### 🔴 Critical
**[<path>]** — <rule name>
> <specific violation>
Fix: <concrete action>

---

### 🟡 Warnings
**[<path>]** — <rule name>
> <specific violation>
Fix: <concrete action>

## Rules

- Group findings by severity, then by file within each group
- Every Critical and Warning must include a concrete `Fix:` line
- If zero findings: emit `✅ All files comply with conventions.` only
- Do not include the raw findings format in output — only the formatted report
