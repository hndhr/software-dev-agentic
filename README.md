# CipherPol

> Claude Code toolkit for Clean Architecture projects

A multi-platform agentic toolkit — agents, skills, and architecture knowledge for Clean Architecture projects. Distributed as **Claude Code plugins**.

**Platforms:** Flutter · iOS (Swift/UIKit) · Android (Kotlin) · Web (Next.js)

---

## How it works

Agents are organized into **personas** — coherent workflow groups (developer, debugger, tracker, auditor, qa). All personas ship in a single `cipherpol-aegis` plugin.

Platform-specific knowledge lives in the **KMS** (ChromaDB-backed MCP server, `cipherpol-8`). Agents query `kms_list` → `kms_query` at runtime, scoped to the project's platform. Project-specific context (feature inventory, deviations, API endpoints) is seeded per project via `/kms-seed`.

Platform is declared once in `settings.local.json` (`CIPHERPOL_PLATFORM`) and cross-checked against `CLAUDE.md`. Agents resolve it automatically — no per-platform plugin needed.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install

From inside the downstream project directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hndhr/software-dev-agentic/main/scripts/install-plugin.sh | bash -s -- --platform=<id>
```

Available platforms:

| `--platform` | KMS id | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| `flutter` | `flutter` | Flutter / Dart / BLoC |
| `ios-swift` | `ios` | iOS / Swift / UIKit |
| `android-kotlin` | `android` | Android / Kotlin |
| `web-nextjs` | `web` | Web / Next.js |

The installer:
- Adds the `cipherpol` marketplace and installs `cipherpol-aegis` + `cipherpol-8` at project scope
- Writes `CIPHERPOL_PLATFORM=<kms_id>` to `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored)
- Writes `**Platform:** <id>` to the managed section of `CLAUDE.md`
- Patches `.mcp.json` with the KMS server entry
- Adds `.claude/agentic-state/` to `.gitignore`

### 2. Register marketplace at user scope (once per machine)

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add hndhr/software-dev-agentic
```

This writes the `cipherpol` entry to `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` — the live Claude Code registry.

> **Migrating from `sda`?** The CLI command above replaces the old entry automatically. If you added `sda` manually via `extraKnownMarketplaces` in `~/.claude/settings.json`, remove that entry.

### 3. Configure project env (`.claude/settings.local.json`)

Written by the installer. Edit manually to override any value.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CIPHERPOL_PLATFORM": "flutter",
    "CIPHERPOL_PROJECT": "talenta"
  },
  "skillListingBudgetFraction": 0.03
}
```

| Key | Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CIPHERPOL_PLATFORM` | `flutter` · `ios` · `android` · `web` | KMS scope for platform knowledge queries |
| `CIPHERPOL_PROJECT` | `talenta` · `jurnal` · `qontak-crm` · `qontak-chat` · any string | KMS scope for project-specific knowledge |
| `skillListingBudgetFraction` | `0.03` (recommended) | Fraction of context budget reserved for skill listing |

`CIPHERPOL_PLATFORM` and `CIPHERPOL_PROJECT` are read by every agent via `detect-platform` before making KMS calls. If both `env` and `CLAUDE.md` are set and disagree, the env var takes precedence and `/cipherpol-status` will flag the conflict.

### 4. Wire the KMS MCP server (`.mcp.json`)

`cipherpol-8` runs as an MCP server. The installer patches this automatically, but if you're setting up manually, add to `.mcp.json` at your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cp8": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "latest=$(ls \"$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/cipherpol/cipherpol-8\" 2>/dev/null | sort -t. -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n | tail -1) && exec bash \"$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/cipherpol/cipherpol-8/$latest/kms/server.sh\""
      ],
      "env": {
        "CP8_ENABLE_LOGGING": "false",
        "CP8_LOG_MAX_MB": "10"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Env | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CP8_ENABLE_LOGGING` | `false` | Enable MCP server request/response logging |
| `CP8_LOG_MAX_MB` | `10` | Max log file size in MB before rotation |

### 5. Activate

Run `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code, then verify with `/cipherpol-status`.

### 6. Seed project knowledge

The plugin ships with platform-level patterns pre-seeded. Add your project's specific knowledge:

```bash
/kms-seed
```

Or extract directly from the codebase:

```bash
/kms-extract-codebase
```

### Updates

```
/plugin marketplace update cipherpol
```

## Recommended Workflows

### Workflow 1 — Tracker Persona

#### 1a — Create Jira Tickets from PRD

**What you need:** Atlassian MCP authenticated · Jira epic key · platform breakdown list

```
/tracker-jira-ticket

epic_key: PROJ-1234
cloud_id: yourcompany.atlassian.net
project_key: PROJ
prd_source: https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/123456789/Feature+PRD

breakdown:
- [ADR] [UI+API] Show location marker on map: 2 days
- [iOS] [UI+API] Show location marker on map: 2 days
```

#### 1b — Update Ticket Progress

```
Session update:

Work items completed:
- Migrated GetLocationListUseCase to new datasource pattern

/tracker-adjust-ticket path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

---

### Workflow 2 — Developer Persona: Groom then build

**Step 1 — Fetch the ticket locally** via Atlassian MCP.

**Step 2 — Groom the ticket**

```
We have some things to address:

1. Cache mechanism in Connection.swift — keep, improve, or replace?
2. Some APIs still use the old pattern — need migration

/developer-groom-ticket path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

**Step 3 — Start a fresh session** (`/clear` or new Claude Code session).

**Step 4 — Plan and build**

```
Let's work on the work items in this ticket.

/developer-plan-feature path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

**Step 5 — Update ticket progress**

```
/tracker-adjust-ticket path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

## Architecture

All agents enforce Clean Architecture:

```
Presentation  →  Domain  ←  Data
```

- **Domain** — pure business logic, zero framework imports. Entities, use cases, repository interfaces.
- **Data** — implements domain interfaces. Remote/DB data sources, mappers, repository implementations.
- **Presentation** — StateHolder (ViewModel / BLoC / Presenter), UI screens, navigation. Depends only on domain.

| Platform | Language | State management |
|---|---|---|
| Flutter | Dart | BLoC / Cubit |
| iOS | Swift | ViewModel + Coordinator |
| Android | Kotlin | Presenter |
| Web | TypeScript | Custom hooks |

Platform pattern knowledge lives in ChromaDB (primary via KMS MCP). Agents always query with `platform=$CIPHERPOL_PLATFORM`.
