# software-dev-agentic

> Claude Code toolkit for Clean Architecture projects — v10.12.0

A multi-platform agentic toolkit — agents, skills, hooks, and architecture reference docs for Clean Architecture projects. Distributed as a **Claude Code plugin**.

**Platforms:** Flutter · iOS (Swift/UIKit) · Android (Kotlin) · Web (Next.js 15)

---

## How it works

Agents are organized into **personas** — coherent workflow groups (developer, debugger, tracker, auditor, installer, qa). All personas ship to every platform plugin.

Knowledge is served by the **KMS** (ChromaDB-backed) — agents query `kms_list` → reason → `kms_fetch` at runtime. Project-specific context (feature inventory, deviations, API endpoints) is seeded per project via `/kms-seed`. Platform pattern knowledge (layers, conventions, patterns) ships pre-seeded inside the plugin.

---

## Setup — Plugin

### Install

From inside the downstream project directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hndhr/software-dev-agentic/main/scripts/install-plugin.sh | bash -s -- --platform=flutter
```

Replace `flutter` with your platform. Available platforms:

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sda-flutter` | Flutter / Dart / BLoC — agents, skills, hooks |
| `sda-ios-swift` | iOS / Swift / UIKit — agents, skills, hooks |
| `sda-android-kotlin` | Android / Kotlin — agents, skills, hooks |
| `sda-web-nextjs` | Web / Next.js 15 — agents, skills, hooks |
| `sda-kms` | KMS MCP server — knowledge store shared by all platforms |

> Install both a platform plugin and `sda-kms`. The platform plugin provides agents and skills; `sda-kms` serves the knowledge queries those agents rely on.

### Configure

Two files are required.

#### `~/.claude/settings.json` (user scope, once)

Register the marketplace and `sda-kms` once — applies to every project on this machine:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "sda": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "hndhr/software-dev-agentic" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "sda-kms@sda": true
  }
}
```

Then register the KMS MCP server at user scope (`~/.claude/.mcp.json`) so it applies globally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kms": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": ["-c", "latest=$(ls \"$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/sda/sda-kms\" 2>/dev/null | sort -t. -k1,1n -k2,2n -k3,3n | tail -1) && exec bash \"$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/sda/sda-kms/$latest/kms/server.sh\""]
    }
  }
}
```

#### `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` (project scope)

Enable the platform plugin per project. Use `.claude/settings.json` to share with the team, or `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) for personal-only:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "sda-flutter@sda": true
  }
}
```

Replace `sda-flutter` with the plugin matching your platform.

Restart Claude Code to activate. Verify with `/kms-status`.

### Seed project knowledge

The plugin ships with platform-level patterns pre-seeded. To add your project's specific knowledge (feature inventory, API endpoints, deviations):

```bash
/kms-seed
```

Or extract directly from the codebase:

```bash
/kms-extract-codebase
```

### Updates

```
/plugin marketplace update sda
```

## What's included

### Agents — by persona

**developer** — feature construction across CLEAN layers

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `developer-feature-strategist` | Brain of the developer persona — decides which layer planners to spawn, synthesizes plan.md + context.md. Never spawns agents or writes files directly. |
| `developer-feature-worker` | Execute an approved feature plan layer by layer |
| `developer-backend-worker` | Build Domain + Data layers directly — entities, use cases, mappers, datasources, repository impls |
| `developer-ui-worker` | Create or update screens and components bound to an existing StateHolder |
| `developer-test-worker` | Route test generation to the correct layer procedure |
| `developer-domain-planner` | Discover Domain layer — entities, use cases, repository interfaces. Read-only. |
| `developer-data-planner` | Discover Data layer — DTOs, mappers, datasources, repository impls. Read-only. |
| `developer-pres-planner` | Discover Presentation layer — StateHolders, screens, components. Read-only. |

**tracker** — issue and ticket lifecycle

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tracker-issue-worker` | Create or pick up a GitHub issue, open the feature branch, update backlog |
| `tracker-jira-ticket-worker` | Create Jira tickets under an epic from a platform breakdown list |

**auditor** — architecture compliance

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auditor-arch-review-worker` | Audit code for CLEAN Architecture violations — layer boundaries, entity purity, naming conventions |

**qa** — test case and automation generation

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `qa-testcase-worker` | Generate mobile UI test cases from Jira tickets, PRDs, or Figma designs |
| `qa-automation-worker` | Translate test case CSVs into Maestro YAML automation scripts |

**installer** — project setup

| Agent | Purpose |

## Recommended Workflows

### Workflow 1 — Tracker Persona

#### 1a — Create Jira Tickets from PRD

**What you need:** Atlassian MCP authenticated · Jira epic key · platform breakdown list

```
/tracker-jira-ticket

epic_key: PROJ-1234
cloud_id: yourcompany.atlassian.net
project_key: PROJ
prd_source: https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/123456789/Feature+PRD

breakdown:
- [ADR] [UI+API] Show location marker on map: 2 days
- [iOS] [UI+API] Show location marker on map: 2 days
- [ADR] [UI] Show location accuracy perimeter: 1 day
- [iOS] [UI] Show location accuracy perimeter: 1 day
```

The worker parses the breakdown, fetches the PRD, generates structured Jira descriptions, shows a preview table, and creates all tickets under the epic.

#### 1b — Update Ticket Progress

```
Session update:

Work items completed:
- Migrated GetLocationListUseCase to new datasource pattern

Decisions:
- Replaced old caching layer entirely

/tracker-adjust-ticket path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

---

### Workflow 2 — Developer Persona: Groom then build

**Step 1 — Fetch the ticket locally** via Atlassian MCP.

**Step 2 — Groom the ticket**

```
We have some things to address:

1. Cache mechanism in Connection.swift — keep, improve, or replace?
2. Some APIs still use the old pattern — need migration
3. Force call bypassing TTL — pass force: Bool from presentation to data layer

/developer-groom-ticket path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

**Step 3 — Start a fresh session** (`/clear` or new Claude Code session).

**Step 4 — Plan and build**

```
Let's work on the work items in this ticket.

/developer-plan-feature path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

Claude reads the groomed ticket, runs the convergence planning loop, presents a plan for approval, then executes layer by layer — Domain → Data → Presentation → UI.

**Step 5 — Update ticket progress**

```
/tracker-adjust-ticket path/to/TICKET-123.md
```

---

## Architecture

All agents enforce Clean Architecture:

```
Presentation  →  Domain  ←  Data
```

- **Domain** — pure business logic, zero framework imports. Entities, use cases, repository interfaces.
- **Data** — implements domain interfaces. Remote/DB data sources, mappers, repository implementations.
- **Presentation** — StateHolder (ViewModel / BLoC / Presenter), UI screens, navigation. Depends only on domain.

| Platform | Language | State management |
|---|---|---|
| Flutter | Dart | BLoC / Cubit |
| iOS | Swift | ViewModel + Coordinator |
| Android | Kotlin | Presenter |
| Web | TypeScript | Custom hooks |

Platform pattern knowledge lives in `lib/core/knowledge/` (fallback) and ChromaDB (primary via KMS MCP).
