---

## [3.67.0] — 2026-05-10

### Changed
- All core trigger skills renamed to carry their persona name as prefix — consistent with existing `builder-*` convention:
  `build-from-ticket` → `builder-build-from-ticket`, `clear-runs` → `builder-clear-runs`, `backend-orchestrator` → `builder-backend`, `debug-orchestrator` → `detective-debug`, `arch-review` → `auditor-arch-review`, `issue-worker` → `tracker-issue`, `doctor` → `installer-doctor`, `setup-worker` → `installer-setup`, `sync` → `installer-sync`
- All slash-command references updated across agent descriptions, CLAUDE-templates (web/ios/flutter/android), platform setup skills, README, and CLAUDE.md
- `agentic-perf-review` and `release` unchanged — `perf-worker` is ungrouped (no persona folder yet); `release` is a repo utility

---

## [3.66.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- `scripts/setup-ai.sh`: Phase 2 skill compilation — compiles `lib/` skills into Gemini CLI (`.agents/skills/` symlinks + `.gemini/commands/*.toml`) and Copilot (`.github/agents/*.agent.md` + `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`) formats after Phase 1 config generation
- `scripts/clean-ai.sh`: Phase 2 cleanup — removes compiled skill artifacts; surgical for Copilot (`.github/` may have user files), aggressive for Gemini-owned dirs

### Changed
- `scripts/clean-ai.sh`: `--platform=` flag added (now required, symmetric with `setup-ai.sh`)
- `docs/multi-ai-platform-initiative.md`: moved to `docs/initiatives/multi-ai-platform-initiative.md`

---

## [3.65.4] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`: Android app-layer reference doc
- `lib/core/agents/builder/app-planner.md`: Android glob patterns

### Changed
- `lib/core/skills/builder-plan-feature/SKILL.md`, `lib/core/skills/builder-build-feature/SKILL.md`: renamed from `plan-feature` / `feature-orchestrator`

### Fixed
- `lib/core/skills/builder-build-feature/SKILL.md`: name collision resolved, `user-invocable` added, app-planner web path corrected
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: extension point path restored after sed rename corruption

---

## [3.65.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- `lib/core/reference/builder/app-layer.md`: two new canonical headings — `## Analytics Constants` and `## Feature Flag Registration` (platform-agnostic theory)
- `lib/platforms/ios/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`: iOS implementations — `{Feature}FirebaseName.swift` struct pattern for analytics; `FeatureFlagKey` + `FeatureFlagCollection` registration steps in `Shared/Infrastructure/FeatureFlag/FeatureFlag.swift`
- `lib/platforms/flutter/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`: Flutter stubs for Analytics Constants and Feature Flag Registration (discovery-oriented — pattern varies by project)

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/app-planner.md`: added Steps 5–6 (locate analytics constants files; locate feature flag registration files); Output block gains `### Analytics Constants` and `### Feature Flag Registration` sections; Naming Conventions gains `analytics_pattern` and `feature_flag_pattern`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-planner.md`: `## App Layer` plan.md table gains Analytics Constants and Feature Flag Registration rows
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-worker.md`: App Layer execution section gains special-case handling for Analytics Constants (create) and Feature Flag Registration (update/skip)
- `lib/core/reference/builder/app-layer.md`, `lib/platforms/ios/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`, `lib/platforms/flutter/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`: corrected `<!-- N -->` line counts on `## Module Registration` sections

## [3.64.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- `lib/core/agents/builder/app-planner.md`: new planner agent — explores DI registration, route registration, and module registration patterns for a feature; returns structured `## App Findings` block; no writes
- `lib/core/reference/builder/app-layer.md`: platform-agnostic theory for Dependency Registration, Route Registration, and Module Registration concepts
- `lib/platforms/ios/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`: iOS/Needle/Coordinator patterns for all three app-layer concerns
- `lib/platforms/flutter/reference/contract/builder/app-layer.md`: Flutter/get_it/BaseModule patterns for all three app-layer concerns

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-planner.md`: Phase 2 spawns `app-planner` in parallel alongside the three layer planners; Phase 3 aggregates `## App Findings`; `context.md` format gains `### App` discovered-artifacts table; `plan.md` format gains `## App Layer` table after `## UI Layer`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-worker.md`: execution order extended with App Layer (order 5); per-artifact workflow section adds App Layer direct-edit procedure (no skill — always `Read` + `Edit`); `state.json` schema gains `"app"` key; Output block gains `### App` section
- `docs/principles/core-design-principles.md`: Layer Isolation section updated — references all four planners (`app-planner` added); `feature-planner` description corrected to "four planners in parallel"

## [3.63.0] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- `docs/principles/core-design-principles.md`: restructured into 5 Core Design Principles + separate Reference, Taxonomy, and Anatomy top-level sections; Context Isolation and Fail-Fast folded as subsections under Agents = Brain; corrected context relay framing (disk reads + trigger skill as bridge, not cache TTL); confirmed `agents:` frontmatter field as undocumented (verified 2026-05-09); Agents and Skills taxonomy entries grouped under parent sections with subsections
- `docs/multi-ai-platform-initiative.md`: extended platform equivalence tables — Copilot prose-delegation workaround for orchestrator/worker and planner patterns; layer isolation and DI at skill level Copilot/Gemini notes; fixed Gemini isolated context inconsistency; added Gemini context relay partial workaround via `@{file}` injection; updated Grep-first and resume routing portability; corrected Architecture Reference section framing; hooks Convention column updated to reflect actual shell hook categories
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: corrected context relay bullet (removed cache pricing, added `plan.md`); updated trigger skill card and anatomy handoff table to include `plan.md`

## [3.62.0] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- `docs/multi-ai-platform-initiative.md`: full rewrite — Principles × Platform Equivalence tables with Official/Convention split per platform (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot); phases derived from principles; verified Gemini CLI subagent system, custom commands, skill frontmatter; verified Copilot agent system
- `docs/principles/core-design-principles.md`: natural language routing removed — trigger skills are the only supported entry path; Type B (destructive) skill type retired — automated bash belongs in hooks, not skills; taxonomy updated to A/T/U only
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: Type B row removed from skills taxonomy table; caption updated to reference hooks for bash execution
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: direct invocation now hard-stops instead of warn-and-proceed

### Fixed
- `lib/platforms/ios/skills/`: 5 skills misclassified as Type B (`disable-model-invocation: true`) — all migrated to Type U (`user-invocable: true`): `generate-changelog`, `audit-presentation-test`, `migrate-presentation`, `migrate-usecase`, `sonar-check`

## [3.61.0] — 2026-05-09

### Changed
- `docs/multi-ai-platform-initiative.md`: Copilot section rewritten — no skill invocation primitive, Phase 2 does not apply; expanded platform equivalence tables
- `docs/`: reorganized root files into semantic subdirectories — `core-design-principles.md` + `submodule-repo-structure.md` → `principles/`; `stakeholder-brief.md` → `deck/`; `contract-schema-improvement-backlog.md` → `initiatives/`; all inbound references updated

### Removed
- `docs/collaboration.md`: obsolete PM–engineer workflow referencing `/pickup-issue` and `/create-issue` skills
- `docs/changelog-core-design-principles.md`: stale since v3.21.0; superseded by `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/changelog-submodule-repo-structure.md`: stale since v3.21.0; superseded by `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/detective-agent-design.md`: draft superseded by `docs/persona/detective.md`

- `docs/agentic-performance-report-apr-2026.md`: narrative summary, no inbound references
- `docs/ai-fluency-test-study.md`: study doc, no inbound references

## [3.60.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`: `reference.local/` support — created at setup time, linked with highest priority (local > platform > core); override-only, no extension mechanism
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: new slide s9a — "Override without forking. Extend without copying." — local directories table, priority order, reference override-only rationale
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: reference docs taxonomy section (Core / Platform / Project by scope); expanded consumer modes table to include `reference.local/`; local directories table with override/extend support per directory

## [3.59.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `scripts/setup-ai.sh`: generates AI assistant config file from template — `--ai=copilot|gemini`, `--platform=<platform>`, `--app-name=<name>`; writes `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `GEMINI.md`; prompts before overwriting
- `scripts/clean-ai.sh`: removes AI assistant config file — `--ai=copilot|gemini`; prompts before deleting
- `lib/ai-platforms/copilot/template.md`: Copilot instructions template — Clean Architecture layers, creation order, naming conventions, hard rules; placeholders for `[APP_NAME]` and `[PLATFORM]`
- `lib/ai-platforms/gemini/template.md`: Gemini instructions template — same content as Copilot template plus `@import` directives for `.claude/reference/` docs
- `docs/multi-ai-platform-initiative.md`: planning doc for multi-AI platform support — Phase 1 (context files), Phase 2 (native skills), Phase 3 (hooks); capability gap table per platform

### Changed
- `scripts/sda.sh`: extended interactive menu with `Add AI` (option 3) and `Remove AI` (option 4); wires to `setup-ai.sh` and `clean-ai.sh`; Claude setup and sync unchanged

## [3.58.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `scripts/sda.sh`: new CLI entry point — interactive menu for `setup` (first-time wiring) and `sync` (pull latest + re-wire); prompts for platform when not passed; delegates to `setup-symlinks.sh` and `sync.sh`
- `lib/platforms/ios/skills/`: promoted 13 skills from `talenta-ios/.claude/skills.local/` — `data-create-datasource`, `data-create-mapper`, `data-create-repository-impl`, `domain-create-entity`, `domain-create-repository`, `domain-create-service`, `domain-create-usecase`, `pres-create-component`, `pres-create-screen`, `pres-create-stateholder`, `test-create-data`, `test-create-domain`, `test-create-presentation`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/backend-orchestrator.md`: rebuilt — calls skills directly in layer order (no sub-agents); handles Domain + Data layers for a feature
- `lib/core/skills/backend-orchestrator/SKILL.md`: entry trigger for the rebuilt `backend-orchestrator`

### Changed
- `scripts/sync.sh`: explicit `git pull origin main` for plain-clone path

### Removed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/domain-worker.md`: dead weight — superseded by `feature-worker` and `backend-orchestrator`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/data-worker.md`: dead weight — superseded by `feature-worker` and `backend-orchestrator`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/presentation-worker.md`: dead weight — superseded by `feature-worker`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/pres-orchestrator.md`: dead weight — no active skill entry point

## [3.57.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- `lib/core/skills/builder-groom-ticket/SKILL.md`: new user-invocable skill — entry trigger for the ticket grooming workflow; accepts optional ticket path, reads ticket content, spawns `groom-orchestrator`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/groom-orchestrator.md`: new orchestrator — maps ticket acceptance criteria to CLEAN layers, spawns only in-scope layer planners (domain/data/pres) in parallel using grooming-only mode, aggregates a compact grooming summary, then auto-chains to `tracker-adjust-ticket`; sits between ticket fetch and `/plan-feature` in the pre-build workflow

---

## [3.56.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- `docs/core-design-principles.md §6`: ubiquitous language authoring rule — H2 headings in cross-platform reference docs must be identical for the same concept (horizontal contract); documents vertical vs horizontal contract distinction
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: new slide s9c — canonical headings and Ubiquitous Language (DDD); bad/good code panels, vertical vs horizontal contract table; deck is now 20 slides

### Fixed
- All cross-platform `reference/contract/builder/` H2 headings standardized to canonical terms: `## Repository Interfaces` (was `## Repository Protocols` on iOS), `## State Management` (was `## State` / `## QueryState` / `## ViewModel State Management` / `## ViewDataState`), `## Null Safety Extensions` (was `## Null Safety Utilities` on web/flutter), `## Presenter Tests` (was `## ViewModel Tests` / `## ViewModel Hook Tests` / `## BLoC Tests`), `## HTTP Client` (was `## Networking (Moya)` on iOS), `## HTTP Error Interceptor` (was `## Dio Error Interceptor` on flutter/error-handling)
- iOS `domain-create-repository` skill: grep target `## Repository Protocols` → `## Repository Interfaces`
- iOS `pres-create-stateholder` skill: grep target `## ViewModel State Management` → `## State Management`
- iOS `test-create-presentation` skill: grep target `## ViewModel Tests` → `## Presenter Tests`
- Web `test-create-presentation` skill: grep target `## ViewModel Hook Tests` → `## Presenter Tests`
- Web `test-create-mock` skill: grep target `## ViewModel Hook Tests` → `## Presenter Tests`
- Flutter `test-create-presentation` skill: grep target `## BLoC Tests` → `## Presenter Tests`
- Flutter `reference/index.md`: section description updated to `Presenter Tests`
- Flutter `error-handling.md`: cross-reference updated to `## HTTP Error Interceptor`
- Line counts refreshed across all affected reference files via `update-ref-counts.sh`

## [3.55.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/error-handling.md`: new — `## Error Flow`, `## Error Types`, `## Error Mapping`, `## Error UI` covering `DomainException`, `ErrorHandler`, and `onErrorResumeNext` patterns
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/navigation.md`: new — `## Navigator` (custom `NavigationImpl` pattern) and `## Route Constants` stub
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/domain.md`: added `## Services` and `## Domain Errors` sections
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/presentation.md`: added `## State` (MVP View interface as state surface) and `## Shared Component Paths`
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/testing.md`: added `## Test Pyramid` and `## Repository Tests` with full Mockito example
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/utilities.md`: added `## StorageService`, `## DateService`, `## Logger` stubs
- `arch-check-conventions`: new `## Reference Doc Section Line-Count Check` — every `##` heading must carry `<!-- N -->` integer; missing or non-integer is a Warning violation
- `docs/core-design-principles.md §6`: authoring rule for `<!-- N -->` line-count convention (writer-side documentation)

### Changed
- `lib/platforms/ios/reference/contract/builder/data.md`: `## Response Models (DTOs)` → `## DTOs`; iOS naming explained in section body
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/data.md`: `## Response Models` → `## DTOs`; `## API Service` → `## Data Sources`; platform naming explained in body
- `arch-review-worker`: platform scope now includes `reference/contract/**/*.md`; adds `reference-doc` as third file classification routing to Contract Schema + Line-Count checks
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: corrected `feature-orchestrator` flow (spawns `feature-worker`, not individual layer workers); Android promoted from "coming soon" to active; removed false pre-commit hook claim

### Fixed
- All Android reference contract files now satisfy `builder-auditor-schema.md` keyword requirements — schema check passes for all 8 required files

---

## [3.54.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- `lib/platforms/android/`: new Android platform for Kotlin/MVP (Dagger 2 + RxJava 3) projects
- `lib/platforms/android/skills/contract/` (12 skills): full builder persona contract skill set — `domain-create-entity`, `domain-create-repository`, `domain-create-usecase`, `domain-create-service`, `data-create-datasource`, `data-create-mapper`, `data-create-repository-impl`, `pres-create-stateholder`, `pres-create-screen`, `test-create-domain`, `test-create-data`, `test-create-presentation`
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/contract/builder/` (6 files): `domain.md`, `data.md`, `presentation.md`, `di.md`, `utilities.md`, `testing.md` — all reflecting real Talenta Android patterns (`BaseMvpVbActivity`, `BaseMvpPresenter`, `doOnSubscribe`/`doFinally`, `addToDisposables()`, `given/when/then` test naming)
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/error-handling.md`: `ErrorHandler`, `ApiException`, `ErrorInterceptor` — platform-specific, not a contract file
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/network.md`: Retrofit/OkHttp setup, `AuthInterceptor` — platform-specific
- `lib/platforms/android/reference/project.md`: module structure, naming conventions, build commands
- `lib/platforms/android/CLAUDE-template.md` and `settings-template.jsonc`

### Changed
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`: added `android` to supported platforms list and usage/validation message
- `docs/persona/builder.md`: updated Android implementation reference row to reflect new platform stub

---

## [3.53.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- `lib/platforms/flutter/reference/index.md`: new index listing all 6 contract reference files with sections and Grep pattern — enables workers to satisfy the P6 Grep-first rule when uncertain which file covers a topic
- `agent-audit-worker`: Check 7 — platform skill parity via Glob comparison; audits a platform's `skills/contract/` dir against sibling platforms and reports gaps based on actual file presence, not assumed names

### Changed
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: P1 Skill-First Entry — `build-from-ticket` added as third builder entry skill (CI/remote non-interactive path); P2 DI at Skill Level — skills-are-create-only rule added; P3 skill naming note — stale `update-*` reference removed
- `docs/persona/builder.md`: Skill Roster — create-only callout added above table
- `docs/submodule-repo-structure.md`: Decision 1 naming pattern and "What Goes Where" Platform-contract skills row both state create-only constraint
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: Type A skill description updated from "Standard build / update procedures" to reflect create-only nature
- `agent-audit-worker`: hard constraint added at top of Checks section — every "missing" finding must be grounded in a Glob result, never inferred from framework or domain knowledge

### Fixed
- `lib/platforms/flutter/skills/contract/` (all 9 skills): removed Fix G `Rules:` prose blocks; non-obvious constraints inlined as code comments in templates; reference docs carry the full specification
- `data-create-repository-impl/SKILL.md`: corrected `reference/contract/builder/error-handling.md` → `.claude/reference/contract/builder/error-handling.md` (missing `.claude/` prefix)
- `arch-review-orchestrator`: Intent Routing table phase labels aligned with three-phase body structure — audit/review now explicitly show they skip Phase 2 and go to Phase 3 (report)

---

## [3.52.3] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: moved "Plan first / Build directly" `AskUserQuestion` from the orchestrator agent into the skill (Step 4) — option menus only work in the main session
- `feature-orchestrator` agent: replaced `new` trigger with `build-directly`; agent no longer calls interactive option menus
- `plan-feature` skill: Step 1 now spawns `feature-orchestrator (Trigger: plan-first)` instead of `feature-planner` directly, keeping routing in the agent layer

## [3.52.2] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- `plan-feature` skill: moved plan approval `AskUserQuestion` (Approve / Discuss more / Discard) out of `feature-orchestrator` and into the skill itself — `AskUserQuestion` with options only works in the main session, not inside spawned sub-agents
- `feature-orchestrator`: added `execute-approved-plan` trigger for post-approval execution; removed approval loop that could never surface interactive options

## [3.52.1] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- `feature-orchestrator`: plan approval `AskUserQuestion` (Approve / Discuss more / Discard) moved from `feature-planner` to the orchestrator — sub-agents cannot surface interactive UI, causing the prompt to collapse to prose text

## [3.52.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- `build-from-ticket`: new one-shot skill for remote AI tools (CI jobs, API callers) — fetches a Jira ticket via `getJiraIssue` or `mmpa_get_jira`, derives planning inputs inline, runs `auto-feature-planner`, then `feature-worker`, and cleans up run state on exit. Fail-fast `error.md` writes surface failures in PR diffs rather than hung jobs.
- `auto-feature-planner`: non-interactive fork of `feature-planner` — accepts pre-filled intent block, never calls `AskUserQuestion`, auto-approves plan after writing `plan.md` + `context.md`. Designed for `build-from-ticket` and future CI callers.

### Changed
- `feature-worker`: load platform `utilities.md` during pre-flight and enforce null safety extension methods (`.orZero()`, `.orEmpty()`, `.orFalse()`) over raw `??` and `!` across all artifacts and platforms
- `feature-worker`: added Run Directory Ownership guard — cleanup of `runs/<feature>/` is the calling skill's responsibility, not the agent's
- `feature-orchestrator` agent: refactored to mode-based routing (`plan-first` / `resume` / `new`); removed old `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `pres-orchestrator` phase chain — replaced by single `feature-worker` spawn. Added hot/cold start guidance in Search Protocol.
- `plan-feature` skill: simplified to a single `feature-orchestrator` agent spawn with `Trigger: plan-first` — all orchestration logic now lives in the agent
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: resume path now routes through `feature-orchestrator` agent (previously spawned `feature-worker` directly, bypassing orchestrator)
- `debug-orchestrator` agent: scoping budget capped at 2 tool calls; intake assessment table added; `.pbxproj` and build-system metadata reads blocked

## [3.51.4] — 2026-04-28

### Changed
- `debug-orchestrator` skill: intake now collects `Target files` from context/ticket (skips the question if already named); spawn prompt includes `Target files` field so the agent never needs to discover what the caller already knows
- `debug-add-logs` iOS skill: added `## Inputs` section defining the expected contract (`Bug description`, `Entry point`, `Target files`, `Expected / Actual`) — aligns with what debug-orchestrator passes

## [3.51.3] — 2026-04-28

### Changed
- `debug-orchestrator`: Step 2 now includes an intake assessment table — classifies what is known before any tool call and maps directly to the required action (skip, one Grep, or route immediately with `layer: unknown`)
- `debug-orchestrator`: added 2-call exploration budget with explicit stopping condition; explicit ban on reading `.pbxproj`, `.xcworkspace`, and build-system metadata

## [3.51.2] — 2026-04-26

### Changed
- `agent-scaffold-worker`: Step 4 "Gather Details" now asks each detail one question at a time via `AskUserQuestion` — numbered sequence per type (Worker, Orchestrator, Skill, New Persona) with explicit "do not bundle" rule, matching the interactive pattern used in `tracker-adjust-ticket`

## [3.51.1] — 2026-04-26

### Changed
- `tracker-adjust-ticket`: split `### Decisions & Open Questions` into separate `### Decisions` (prose bullets with rationale) and `### Open Questions` (checklist) sections; both omitted when empty — aligns template to real ticket structure

## [3.51.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `feature-worker`: Search Protocol section — Grep-first table, Read-once rule, explicit ban on bash grep as a substitute for the Grep tool
- `tracker-adjust-ticket`: Acceptance Criteria duplicate into Session Adjustment on every update; `### Work Items` checklist for per-session progress tracking

### Changed
- `debug-worker`: added bash-grep callout to existing Search Protocol — Bash grep does not reduce Read tool count and bypasses token-efficiency audit
- `tracker-adjust-ticket`: write boundary now strictly locked to `## Session Adjustment` section only; original ticket content is never touched

## [3.50.1] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- `feature-planner`: Phase 5 now shows plan path + numbered step list (`ArtifactName → short description`) before prompting for approval — previously showed nothing
- `feature-planner`: agent can no longer pre-announce "Plan approved" before the user selects Approve in AskUserQuestion

## [3.50.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `/sync` toolkit skill (`lib/core/skills/sync/SKILL.md`): pull latest submodule + re-run setup-symlinks in one command; auto-detects platform from existing symlinks, falls back to asking user

### Changed
- `scripts/sync.sh`: `--platform` is now optional — auto-detected from `.claude/skills/domain-create-entity` symlink target when omitted; fails with a clear message only if detection fails and flag is absent

## [3.49.2] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: Anatomy of a Persona section — layer diagram, handoff contracts table, state files table
- `docs/persona/builder.md`: Anatomy section — dual entry skill diagram, planner phase breakdown, execution phase description, standalone paths
- `docs/persona/detective.md`: Anatomy section — investigation sequence diagram, tool isolation constraint, short-circuit path, handoff boundary

### Changed
- `docs/persona/builder.md`: Agent Roster updated — added `feature-worker`, `domain-planner`, `data-planner`, `pres-planner`; `feature-planner` reclassified as Planner; Layer-to-Agent Mapping adds Planner column; Skill Roster adds `domain-create-service`, removes stale update skills

## [3.49.1] — 2026-04-25

### Changed
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: added Planner as a first-class taxonomy entry — `-planner` suffix in naming convention table, Planner row in Agents By Role table, Planners in DI at Skill Level analogy, and "Planner vs Worker" decision rule (complexity/scale determines which to use first)

## [3.49.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `feature-worker`: plan-driven executor — reads approved plan.md, calls skills in layer order (domain → data → presentation → UI), validates each artifact inline via Glob+Grep, tracks per-artifact state.json, handles stateholder-contract handoff, and supports auth interruption recovery

### Changed
- `/plan-feature` skill: execution step now spawns `feature-worker` instead of `feature-orchestrator`; plan.md passed inline alongside context.md
- `/feature-orchestrator` skill: resume path now spawns `feature-worker` with plan+context inline; new-call path routes to `feature-planner` for plan-first flow
- `feature-orchestrator` agent: `agents:` list updated to include `feature-worker` and `feature-planner`

## [3.48.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- `domain-planner`: explore-only agent — discovers entities, use cases, repository interfaces, domain services; returns structured findings, no writes
- `data-planner`: explore-only agent — discovers DTOs, mappers, datasources, repository implementations; returns structured findings, no writes
- `pres-planner`: explore-only agent — discovers StateHolders, screens, components, navigators + key symbols (event cases, state fields, constructor params); no writes

### Changed
- `feature-planner`: Phase 2 now spawns domain-planner, data-planner, and pres-planner in parallel via Agent tool, replacing the single Explore agent; aggregates three structured findings blocks into context.md + plan.md; added `Agent` to tools and `agents:` frontmatter list

## [3.47.1] — 2026-04-25

### Changed
- `feature-planner`: enforce 60-line read budget on Explore agent — offset+limit required after Grep, never unbounded Read; Key Symbols extraction uses Grep line number + ±30 line window
- `feature-planner`: Search Protocol updated — all Reads capped at `limit=60`, unbounded Read on a large file is an explicit violation

## [3.47.0] — 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Skills are now create-only: workers handle artifact modifications via direct `Read` + `Edit` with reference docs — no skill wrapper needed for updates
- `extract-session.sh`: fix path slug encoding for dotted usernames — dots now encoded as dashes to match Claude's actual `~/.claude/projects/` folder format; added fuzzy basename fallback
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: updated precondition rule to reflect direct-edit model for existing artifacts

### Removed
- All update and fix skills across iOS, Flutter, and Web (18 skill dirs): `data-update-mapper`, `domain-update-usecase`, `pres-update-screen`, `pres-update-stateholder`, `test-update`, `test-fix`
- Corresponding pointers removed from worker frontmatter (`related_skills`), routing tables, precondition rules, agent descriptions, `perf-worker`, `flutter/README`, `ios/test-orchestrator`, and `web/skills/README`

## [3.46.3] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `tracker-adjust-ticket`: update in place instead of appending — exactly one `## Session Adjustment` section, date reflects last update

## [3.46.2] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- CLAUDE-template.md (ios, web, flutter): replaced agent list with skill-first entry rule; removed stale delegation guard hook line

## [3.46.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh` prune loop: removed invalid `2>/dev/null` redirect from `for ... in` glob expansion (bash syntax error on line 167)

## [3.46.0] — 2026-04-24

### Removed
- `scripts/local-setup-symlinks.sh`, `scripts/local-sync.sh` — local (non-submodule) variants no longer needed
- `scripts/manage-packages.sh`, `scripts/local-manage-packages.sh` — package management scripts removed with packages
- `disabled-hooks` guard from all 3 web hooks (`check-use-server.sh`, `block-impl-import-in-presentation.sh`, `lint-on-edit.sh`) — skill-first entry replaces hook-level guards
- `feature-dirs` check from `doctor` skill — delegation hook retired, fragment config no longer relevant
- `config/` directory creation from `setup-symlinks.sh` — nothing writes there anymore

## [3.45.1] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: updated presentation deck to reflect Skill-First Entry architecture — added Trigger Skill as 4th role (slides 11, 12), updated entry flows to show slash commands (slides 14, 16), added trigger skill column to personas table (slide 15), added context relay bullet to caching slide (slide 8), fixed slide counter

## [3.45.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- `setup-symlinks.sh`: now does full managed-section sync on `CLAUDE.md` (replaces content between markers on re-run, not just skip)

### Changed
- `sync.sh`: simplified to pull + delegate to `setup-symlinks.sh` — all link/prune/CLAUDE.md logic is now in one place
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `submodule-repo-structure.md`, `setup-nextjs-project/SKILL.md`, `setup-worker.md`, `agent-scaffold-worker.md`: updated all references from `setup-packages.sh` → `setup-symlinks.sh`

### Removed
- `scripts/setup-packages.sh` — selective persona installation no longer needed; all personas install by default
- `scripts/local-setup-packages.sh` — removed alongside `setup-packages.sh`
- `packages/*.pkg` — package definition files no longer needed
- Lockfile (`config/installed-packages`) — removed from `setup-symlinks.sh`; no package selection to track

## [3.44.4] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `core-design-principles.md`: reframed Principle 1 from "Natural Language as the Entry Point" to "Skill-First Entry" — skills are the preferred path; natural language routing is valid but secondary; updated the intro tagline to match

## [3.44.3] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- `arch-review` skill: Type T trigger skill for the auditor persona — presents scope options (file / feature folder / full codebase) then spawns `arch-review-worker`

### Changed
- `arch-review-worker.md`: description updated to "skill-only — invoked only by `/arch-review` skill"

## [3.44.2] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: made AskUserQuestion explicit with `question/header/options` format matching the established pattern
- `plan-feature` skill: added `AskUserQuestion` gate after planner returns — user now picks "Build now" or "Review first" before orchestrator spawns; also stops cleanly if plan was discarded (no context.md found)

## [3.44.1] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- `core-design-principles.md`: clarified Skill-First Entry — multiple workflow skills per persona are allowed when they converge on the same primary entry agent; sub-agents used only as workflow steps do not need standalone trigger skills

## [3.44.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- `backend-orchestrator` skill: Type T trigger skill — owns routing (resume/new), context pre-loading from runs directory, and spawn prompt construction
- `setup-worker` skill: Type T trigger skill — asks platform if not provided, then spawns `setup-worker` agent
- `issue-worker` skill: Type T trigger skill — spawns `issue-worker` agent with `$ARGUMENTS`
- `core-design-principles.md`: Skill-First Entry for Personas principle — every persona's primary entry agent requires a trigger skill; workers remain orchestrator-spawned

### Changed
- `backend-orchestrator.md`: description updated to "skill-only" and added `Pre-flight — Context Check` (same context relay pattern as `feature-orchestrator`)
- `setup-worker.md`, `issue-worker.md`: descriptions updated to "skill-only — invoked only by trigger skill"

## [3.43.3] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: made Agent tool usage explicit in spawn steps (Resume and New call) — same class of fix as `plan-feature` v3.43.2

## [3.43.2] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `plan-feature` skill: changed "Invoke" to "Spawn using the Agent tool" for both `feature-planner` and `feature-orchestrator` — prevents model from calling them as skills (which fails) instead of agents

## [3.43.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- `core.pkg`: added `tracker-adjust-ticket` to skills list so downstream sync picks it up

## [3.43.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- `tracker-adjust-ticket` skill: appends a new `## Session Adjustment` section to a locally fetched Jira ticket `.md` file based on session discussion — captures progress, decisions/blockers, and development status; never modifies existing content

## [3.42.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- `plan-feature` skill: after `feature-planner` completes, reads `context.md` + `state.json` from the runs directory (cache hits in active session) and passes them inline to `feature-orchestrator` spawn — orchestrator starts with context pre-loaded, no cold pre-flight reads
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: owns resume selection via `AskUserQuestion` (one option per existing run + "Start new"); reads selected run's `context.md` + `state.json` and passes inline; new-call path spawns lean and lets orchestrator collect intent
- `feature-orchestrator` agent: `Pre-flight — Context Check` — detects pre-loaded context block in prompt, extracts all needed values, jumps directly to `next_phase`; direct invocation (no skill) warns user and falls back to approved-plan check

### Changed
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: `allowed-tools` expanded to `Bash, Read, AskUserQuestion, Agent`
- `plan-feature` skill: `allowed-tools` expanded to `Bash, Read, Agent`
- `feature-planner` agent: `context.md` added to allowed writes in Constraints
- `clear-runs` skill: note updated to remove `delegation.json` reference

### Removed
- `feature-orchestrator` agent: `Pre-flight — Resume Check` (moved to skill), `Pre-flight — Set Delegation Flag`, and `delegation.json` clear in Phase 4 — delegation mechanism retired in favour of skill-enforced entry point
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh` — delegation guard hook removed; skill is the enforced entry point, user accepts workflow boundary consciously
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`, `sync.sh`, `local-setup-symlinks.sh`, `local-sync.sh`, `local-setup-packages.sh`: hook wiring and `feature-dirs` creation removed; scripts now remove the hook from `settings.json`/`settings.local.json` if present (migration path for existing downstream projects)

## [3.41.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- `feature-planner`: enrich Explore agent to return artifact paths, naming conventions, and key symbols (emitEvent cases, MARK sections, constructor params); write `context.md` alongside `plan.md` so codebase discovery is done once and cached as a file
- `feature-orchestrator`: Correction Mode — trivial single-layer fixes surface to the user for inline edit; complex fixes spawn the layer worker directly, both bypassing full orchestration re-entry and delegation flag re-write
- `feature-orchestrator`: early `state.json` write — initial state written before `domain-worker` spawns so sessions are resumable even if they exit mid-Phase 1
- `feature-orchestrator`: pass `context-path` to `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, and `pres-orchestrator` spawns
- `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `pres-orchestrator`: Context Shortcut — read `context.md` first when provided and skip Glob+Grep discovery; fall back to standard flow for artifacts not in context

### Changed
- `feature-orchestrator`: Phase 1 state write changed from post-worker to pre-worker (early write)

### Fixed
- `docs/perf-report`: revise TE-14689 D3 findings — ViewModel direct edit was correct per `presentation-worker` judgment rule; feature flag files are outside Clean Architecture layers; raise D3 6→8, Overall 7.6→7.9

## [3.40.10] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `sync.sh`: add `link_reference` function and re-link `reference/` after every prune step — the lockfile path only linked agents and skills, leaving `reference/` empty after dangling symlinks were pruned
- `setup-packages.sh`: same fix — add `link_reference` and call it after the prune step so reference files are always present

## [3.40.9] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `setup-symlinks.sh`, `sync.sh`, `setup-packages.sh`: prune dangling `reference/` symlinks recursively — all three scripts previously skipped `reference/` in their prune step, causing broken nested symlinks (e.g. `reference/builder/`, `reference/contract/builder/`) to survive re-runs because `link_if_absent` skips existing symlinks even when dangling

## [3.40.8] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `setup-symlinks.sh`: correct relative path depth in recursive `link_reference` — symlinks inside subdirectories (e.g. `reference/builder/`, `reference/contract/builder/`) were one `../` too shallow, causing broken symlinks in downstream projects
- `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`: enforce skill-before-write precondition — new artifact creation must invoke the corresponding skill before any Write/Edit call to prevent pattern-error rework loops
- `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`: prohibit Bash `cat` reads in Search Protocol — workers must use `Grep` or `Read` tools only
- `feature-orchestrator`: add pre-flight test intent check — pure test-creation requests (matching "create tests", "write tests", etc.) are now routed to `test-worker` instead of self-executing
- `feature-orchestrator`: add auth interruption recovery — orchestrator saves state and surfaces a clear resume message on session expiry rather than stalling silently

## [3.40.7] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `setup-symlinks.sh`: prune dangling symlinks in `agents/`, `skills/`, and `hooks/` after the linking step — re-running the script no longer leaves stale symlinks from deleted skills/agents

## [3.40.6] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `sync.sh`: prune dangling `.claude/hooks/*.sh` symlinks during the stale symlink cleaning step
- `sync.sh`: migrate stale `PROJECT_ROOT/hooks/` placeholder in `settings.local.json` to `.claude/hooks/` on every run (matches fix already in `setup-packages.sh` and `setup-symlinks.sh`)

## [3.40.5] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- All builder agents (`feature-orchestrator`, `feature-planner`, `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`): added **Write Path Rule** — `$(...)` expressions in `file_path` arguments are not evaluated by Write/Edit and produce a literal `__CMDSUB_OUTPUT__` directory; agents must resolve project root via Bash first
- `presentation-worker` step 6: explicit instruction to run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before writing `stateholder-contract.md`

## [3.40.4] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `feature-planner`: Phase 5 and Resume path now explicitly prohibit prose option presentation — `AskUserQuestion` is called immediately with no fallback text
- `feature-planner`: "Edit" option renamed to "Discuss more"; agent stays in conversation and re-presents options instead of dropping out
- `setup-packages.sh` / `setup-symlinks.sh`: detect and migrate stale `PROJECT_ROOT/hooks/` placeholder (from v3.4.0 template) to correct `.claude/hooks/` relative path on every run
- `setup-packages.sh`: prune broken symlinks in `agents/`, `skills/`, and `hooks/` during every install run, removing stale links to deleted skills (e.g. `plan`)

## [3.40.3] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- `feature-orchestrator` skill: directory-based (`SKILL.md`), replaces flat file; agent now asks "plan first or build directly?" when no approved plan exists
- `debug-orchestrator` skill: converted from flat file to directory-based (`SKILL.md`)
- `detective.pkg`: added `debug-orchestrator` to skills
- `feature-orchestrator` agent: new decision step — prompts user to invoke `feature-planner` or proceed inline when no approved plan is found

### Removed
- `lib/core/skills/feature-orchestrator.md` — replaced by `feature-orchestrator/SKILL.md`
- `lib/core/skills/debug-orchestrator.md` — replaced by `debug-orchestrator/SKILL.md`

---

## [3.40.2] — 2026-04-23

### Removed
- `lib/core/skills/plan/` — replaced by `plan-feature`

---

## [3.40.1] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- `sync.sh`: strip trailing slash before `[ -L ]` check so stale skill symlinks are correctly detected and removed
- `builder.pkg`: add `plan-feature` and `feature-orchestrator` to skills so sync links them in downstream projects

---

## [3.40.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- `plan-feature` skill: chains `feature-planner` → `feature-orchestrator` as a single trigger

---

## [3.39.1] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- `test-worker`, `debug-worker`, `debug-log-worker`, `arch-review-worker` (lib/core), `pr-review-worker`, `issue-worker`, `perf-worker`: added Read-once rule and/or full Search Protocol block — these workers had the lookup table but no re-read enforcement
- `backend-orchestrator`, `feature-orchestrator`, `feature-planner`, `pres-orchestrator`, `debug-orchestrator`: added coordinator-scoped Search Protocol (state/run files only, delegate source reads to workers) and Read-once rule

---

## [3.39.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `lib/core/skills/debug-orchestrator.md`: Type T trigger skill — collects missing intake then spawns `debug-orchestrator` agent
- `lib/core/skills/feature-orchestrator.md`: Type T trigger skill — passes optional description and hands off to `feature-orchestrator` agent for Phase 0 intake

### Fixed
- `arch-review-orchestrator`: added `Agent` to `tools` — without it the orchestrator could not spawn any sub-agents and collapsed all work inline
- `arch-review-orchestrator`, `agent-scaffold-worker`, `agent-migrate-worker`, `agent-audit-worker`, `agent-consult-worker`, `arch-review-worker`: upgraded Search Rules to `## Search Rules — Never Violate` with full 4-row table including `^## SectionName → <!-- N --> → Read(offset, limit=N)` bounded-read row and explicit Read-once rule
- `.claude/reference/agent-conventions.md`: added `<!-- N -->` section annotations via `update-ref-counts.sh` — enables bounded Read for all `.claude/agents/` tooling

---

## [3.38.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `scripts/update-ref-counts.sh`: rewrites `## Section` headings in all `lib/*/reference/*.md` files with `<!-- N -->` line count annotations — agents use N as the `Read` limit for targeted section reads; runs standalone (all docs) or per-file
- `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`: auto-runs `update-ref-counts.sh` on staged reference docs only (path-constrained to `lib/*/reference/**/*.md`); silent on all other files
- `docs/deck/agentic-deck.html`: 18-slide HTML presentation deck — covers problems, solutions, architecture, personas, Leave Request walkthrough, results; keyboard + touch swipe navigation
- `docs/deck-plan.md`: planning doc for the deck

### Changed
- All 52 reference docs under `lib/*/reference/`: initial `<!-- N -->` section count annotations applied
- Search Protocol in 8 agents (`domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `ui-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `test-worker`, `arch-review-worker`, `debug-worker`, `pr-review-worker`): updated to `Grep "^## SectionName"` → read `<!-- N -->` from heading → `Read(file, offset=line, limit=N)` — replaces imprecise "Grep for the section heading" instruction
- `lib/core/reference/README.md` "How Agents Use This Directory": updated with same two-step Grep + targeted Read pattern as canonical reference

---

## [3.37.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/` → `lib/core/reference/builder/`: renamed to align reference dir naming with the persona taxonomy — all files in this dir are owned and consumed by the builder persona
- `lib/platforms/{ios,web,flutter}/reference/contract/*.md` → `reference/contract/builder/*.md`: contract reference docs grouped under a persona subdir to make room for future personas (e.g. `contract/detective/`) without restructuring
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`: `link_reference` made fully recursive — handles any depth of subdir nesting; `contract/builder/` and future persona subdirs land downstream automatically with no further script changes
- `scripts/local-sync.sh`: `copy_reference` made fully recursive to match; core reference call updated to pass `lib/core/reference/` root so `builder/` is preserved as a subdir rather than copied flat
- All builder agents (`domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `ui-worker`, `test-worker`, `feature-planner`): Grep paths updated to `reference/builder/` and `reference/contract/builder/`
- All platform contract skills (ios/web/flutter): `reference/contract/` paths updated to `reference/contract/builder/`
- `docs/submodule-repo-structure.md`, `docs/core-design-principles.md`, `docs/contract/README.md`: updated to document `contract/<persona>/` grouping pattern

### Fixed
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`: `link_skills()` now filters `extensions/` in addition to `contract/` — prevents `skills.local/extensions/` from being incorrectly symlinked as a skill downstream

---

## [3.36.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/detective/debug-worker.md`: always reports static analysis findings and ranked hypotheses before any instrumentation — asks the user explicitly before spawning `debug-log-worker`, preventing noisy log runs when static analysis already reveals the root cause
- `lib/core/agents/detective/debug-orchestrator.md`: stripped to a thin router — removed duplicated static analysis and hypothesis formation; orchestrator now only scopes the failure to a CLEAN layer/module and routes to the right worker(s), with a consolidation step for multi-worker runs

---

## [3.35.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `lib/platforms/web/CLAUDE-template.md`: `## Stack` section with placeholder comments for backend-type, ORM, auth, styling, testing, and deployment — agents read CLAUDE.md every session so filling this in once propagates choices automatically
- `lib/platforms/web/skills/setup-nextjs-project/SKILL.md`: Step 5 updated to show the Stack table and prompt engineers to fill it in during initial setup

### Changed
- `scripts/setup-packages.sh`: post-install next steps now lists the six specific stack decisions engineers must fill in, replacing the vague "Fill in CLAUDE.md placeholders" message

---

## [3.34.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`: writes `.claude/config/installed-packages` lockfile on first run, recording all available packages for the platform — ensures subsequent syncs are package-aware without requiring a re-run of `setup-packages.sh`

---

## [3.33.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `lib/platforms/ios/packages/ios.pkg`: iOS platform package — declares `test-orchestrator` and `pr-review-worker` so package-aware sync manages them correctly
- `scripts/setup-packages.sh`: writes `.claude/config/installed-packages` lockfile after installation — records platform and selected package names for use by sync

### Changed
- `scripts/sync.sh`: package-aware sync — reads lockfile, links only installed packages, removes stale submodule-pointing symlinks automatically; falls back to `setup-symlinks.sh` if no lockfile found
- `packages/builder.pkg`: added `feature-planner` to agents list

---

## [3.32.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `agents/detective/debug-log-worker.md`: new worker — the only detective agent with `Edit` access; supports `MODE=add` (hypothesis-tagged log insertion) and `MODE=remove` (cleanup before commit); enforces a structural tool boundary where orchestrator and debug-worker remain read-only
- `docs/persona/detective.md`: detective persona doc — governing theory (Zeller's Scientific Debugging), step-to-agent mapping, tool boundary rule, handoff contract, CLEAN/SOLID/DRY mapping, and future scaling direction
- `docs/detective-agent-design.md`: design rationale doc — captures decisions on detective persona direction, platform workers vs feature-specific workers approach, and token-efficient feature reference doc structure

### Removed
- `agents/detective/prompt-debug-worker.md`: moved out of detective persona — prompt/agent debugging belongs with the perf evaluation workflow; `perf-worker` callout updated with inline guidance

### Changed
- `agents/detective/debug-worker.md`: updated to spawn `debug-log-worker` instead of referencing removed `debug-add-logs` / `debug-remove-logs` skills
- `docs/persona/`: persona docs moved from `docs/` root into `docs/persona/` folder (`persona-builder.md` → `persona/builder.md`, `persona-detective.md` → `persona/detective.md`)
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: updated internal links to reflect `docs/persona/` move

---

## [3.31.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `agents/agent-audit-worker.md`: new worker audits structural integrity of a persona, agent, or skill — verifies `related_skills`, orchestrator `agents:` field, `.pkg` agent lists, hook scripts, and reference doc paths resolve to real files on disk
- `agents/agent-migrate-worker.md`: new worker migrates an existing agent or skill file to convention compliance — audits against `reference/agent-conventions.md`, confirms fix plan with user, applies in a single pass, verifies each fix
- `agents/agent-scaffold-worker.md`: new worker (renamed from `scaffold-worker`) for designing and scaffolding new agentic components; gathers four signals before classifying
- `reference/agent-conventions.md`: new internal greppable convention reference — component types, skill types/scopes, valid type×scope combinations, required frontmatter, required sections, model selection, naming, platform-agnosticism rules, Extension Point standard
- `skills/audit/SKILL.md`: `/audit` Type T trigger skill — routes to `arch-review-orchestrator` with `audit` intent
- `skills/migrate/SKILL.md`: `/migrate` Type T trigger skill — routes to `arch-review-orchestrator` with `migrate` intent
- `skills/scaffold/SKILL.md`: `/scaffold` Type T trigger skill — routes to `arch-review-orchestrator` with `scaffold` intent

### Changed
- `agents/arch-review-orchestrator.md`: expanded to coordinate all four specialist workers (`agent-audit-worker`, `arch-review-worker`, `agent-migrate-worker`, `agent-scaffold-worker`) with intent-based routing — spawns only workers the intent requires; adds verification pass after migrate/scaffold scoped to the affected file only
- `agents/agent-scaffold-worker.md`: Step 2 (Classify) now Greps `reference/agent-conventions.md` instead of embedding the decision tree inline; added `user-invocable: false`, `## Search Rules` section, and output verification in Step 7
- `agents/arch-review-worker.md`: added `user-invocable: false`, normalized `## Search Rules` heading, fixed Extension Point path (removed `.claude/` prefix for repo agent)
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: removed Delivery Mechanism and Folder Design Rationale sections (repo structure content, moved to submodule-repo-structure.md)
- `docs/submodule-repo-structure.md`: added Delivery Mechanism section and Folder Design Rationale (moved from principles); removed D8 Token Efficiency (agent design principle, covered in principles P5); removed dangling Doc Sync System heading; updated stale What Goes Where table rows
- `docs/evaluation/` and `docs/perf-report/`: consolidated from root-level `evaluation/` and `perf-report/` into `docs/` — all active pointers updated across agents, skills, and lib files

### Removed
- `agents/docs-sync-worker.md`: Confluence sync no longer needed as a dedicated internal agent
- `skills/docs-identify-changes/SKILL.md`: companion skill to docs-sync-worker; removed as orphaned

---

## [3.30.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- `skills/scaffold.md`: new `/scaffold` trigger skill — entry point that invokes `agent-scaffold-worker` to generate CLEAN layer scaffolding
- `agents/agent-scaffold-worker.md` (renamed from `scaffold-worker.md`): aligned naming with agent-prefixed convention

### Changed
- `packages/*/package.json`: `hooks` field now supported — builder package declares `require-feature-orchestrator` hook
- `scripts/register-hooks.sh` (and related setup scripts): hooks registered in `settings.json` using relative paths instead of absolute paths
- `scripts/setup-packages.sh`, `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`: settings template renamed from `settings-template.json` to `settings-template.jsonc`

### Fixed
- `scripts/sync.sh`: falls back to `git pull` when `.claude/software-dev-agentic` is a plain clone (not a submodule), preventing sync failures in flat-clone setups

---

## [3.29.0] — 2026-04-21

### Changed
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`, `scripts/setup-packages.sh`, `scripts/local-setup-symlinks.sh`, `scripts/local-setup-packages.sh`: CLAUDE.md handling changed from skip-if-exists to append-if-absent — when a `CLAUDE.md` already exists, the platform-specific `<!-- BEGIN software-dev-agentic:<platform> -->` / `<!-- END software-dev-agentic:<platform> -->` block is appended instead of skipped; re-running is idempotent (skips if marker already present); works for all platforms via the `$PLATFORM` variable

---

## [3.28.0] — 2026-04-20

### Changed
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: extracted Goals, Core Design Decision, Three Consumer Modes, Context Cost Analysis, DI at Skill Level, and Layer Isolation into the principles doc as the single source of truth; removed `isolation: worktree` references
- `docs/submodule-repo-structure.md` (renamed from `shared-submodule-arch.md`): now a pure structural reference — all principles moved to core doc; agent/skill names genericized; setup section merged back in
- `docs/changelog-submodule-repo-structure.md` (renamed from `changelog-shared-submodule-arch.md`)

### Added
- **Layer Isolation** principle (P2): workers have bounded knowledge and write authority — each worker knows only its CLEAN layer's rules and writes only to that layer's files

### Removed
- `isolation: worktree` removed from all orchestrators (`arch-review-orchestrator`, `scaffold-worker`, `debug-orchestrator`, `test-orchestrator`) and from the `arch-check-conventions` checklist — layer isolation in this system means knowledge/authority boundaries, not git worktree isolation

---

## [3.27.0] — 2026-04-20

### Changed
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: restructured for clarity — down from 652 to ~420 lines, 16 principles consolidated to 9; taxonomy promoted to P4 with `####` subsections; orchestrators/memory/naming folded into P2; skills preloading/types folded into P3; delegation rule folded into P1; trigger skill added as second valid entry point; P2 orchestrator section trimmed from 10-step spec to 5 rules; P6 folder structure details moved to arch doc
- `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md`: removed Examples and Open Items sections; principle reference table synced with renumbering

### Added
- `docs/changelog-core-design-principles.md`: version history extracted from core-design-principles.md
- `docs/changelog-shared-submodule-arch.md`: version history extracted from shared-submodule-arch.md
- `docs/persona-builder.md`: new doc consolidating all builder-specific content — agent/skill rosters, layer mapping, execution examples, CLEAN/SOLID/DRY, delegation threshold, implementation reference, open items

---

## [3.26.0] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- `lib/core/agents/detective/debug-worker.md`: added "Third-Party Library Investigation" rule to Search Protocol — use `Grep -rn` before any `find`/`ls` in node_modules or vendor directories; Grep for a related symbol from the error message when the target pattern is unknown; never navigate a vendor directory speculatively with directory listings
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: extended Explore Agent Grep-First Rule with a dynamic pattern exception — Tailwind template strings and runtime-assembled identifiers cannot be matched by literal Grep; in those cases use Glob + targeted Read and require the exploration prompt to document the reason for skipping Grep

### Changed
- `perf-report/xpnsio-2026-04-19-305f9697-split-bill-dropdown-bg-fix.md`: D5 6→8, D6 4→5, Overall 6.7→7.1 — branch routing revised; user-initiated "create issue and pick up" from `main` is intentional; missing PR remains the sole D6 finding
- `perf-report/xpnsio-2026-04-19-e6748dd1-fix-skeleton-height-classes.md`: D5 4→8, D6 3→7, Overall 6.1→7.3 — starting on `main` was correct for the workflow; mid-session branch switch + PR creation was the right sequence

### Added
- `evaluation/11-d5-workflow-intent-and-vendor-grep-first.md`: documents three observations from xpnsio sessions #97 and #99 — D5/D6 false penalisation for user-initiated main-branch workflow, node_modules `find`/`ls` token overhead (~31% of session), and the dynamic class name gap in the Grep-first rule

---

## [3.25.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: redirect all block output to stderr (`>&2`) — Claude Code reads stderr for hook messages; stdout is silently discarded, which caused "No stderr output" and Claude falling back to plain-text instead of invoking `AskUserQuestion`

---

## [3.25.0] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: replaced fragmented `echo` block with a `cat <<'EOF'` heredoc that opens with an imperative mandate ("You MUST call the AskUserQuestion tool RIGHT NOW — do not respond in plain text") followed by the exact JSON input; previous format caused Claude to paraphrase the options as prose instead of invoking the tool

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-planner.md`: both `AskUserQuestion` call sites (pre-flight resume check and Phase 5 confirm) now specify the full call structure — `question`, `header`, `multiSelect`, `options[].label`, `options[].description` — instead of vague "Present using AskUserQuestion" prose
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: pre-flight resume check `AskUserQuestion` call now specifies full call structure consistently with feature-planner

---

## [3.24.2] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `docs/contract/README.md`: index and structural rules for `docs/contract/` — heading format, validation snippet, adding a new platform; extracted from `builder-auditor-schema.md`

### Changed
- `docs/contract/arch-check.md` → `docs/contract/builder-auditor-schema.md`: renamed to reflect dual ownership (builder greps, auditor enforces); keyword tables only — structural rules moved to README
- `skills/arch-check-conventions/SKILL.md`: schema path updated to `docs/contract/builder-auditor-schema.md`
- `docs/contract-schema-improvement-backlog.md`: path references updated

---

## [3.24.1] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- `docs/contract/schema.md` → `docs/contract/arch-check.md`: renamed to reflect owning persona (`arch-check-conventions` / auditor); `docs/contract/` preserved as home for future persona contracts
- `docs/contract/improvement-backlog.md` → `docs/contract-schema-improvement-backlog.md`: moved to flat `docs/` — backlog doc, not a contract spec
- `skills/arch-check-conventions/SKILL.md`: schema path updated to `docs/contract/arch-check.md`

---

## [3.24.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `docs/contract/schema.md`: contract keyword registry relocated here from `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/` — internal-only spec; no longer ships to downstream projects via symlink
- `docs/contract/improvement-backlog.md`: documents 4 schema gaps confirmed not yet safe to register (pending platform `##` heading alignment): `presentation.md` Events/Input + Actions/Output, `testing.md` Use Case Tests naming reconciliation, `di.md` Scope Rules + Registration Order

### Changed
- `docs/contract/schema.md`: `Services` keyword added to `domain.md` table — substring of `## Services` (web/iOS) and `## Domain Services` (flutter); `arch-check-conventions` now enforces this on all platforms
- `skills/arch-check-conventions/SKILL.md`: schema reference path updated to `docs/contract/schema.md`
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: `contract-schema.md` removed from P7 "universal theory" list — spec docs are not architecture theory
- `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md`: same — removed from Decision 4 universal theory list

### Removed
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/contract-schema.md`: misplaced as architecture reference theory; superseded by `docs/contract/schema.md`

---

## [3.23.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `lib/platforms/web/skills/contract/data-create-mapper`, `data-create-datasource`, `data-create-repository-impl`, `data-update-mapper`: replaced legacy `§ N.N` section references with canonical `## Heading` Grep pointers
- `lib/platforms/web/skills/contract/pres-create-stateholder`, `pres-create-screen`: replaced `§ 5.x` and `§ 6.2`, `§ 15.6` with canonical `## Heading` Grep pointers across `presentation.md`, `navigation.md`, and `ssr.md`
- `lib/platforms/web/skills/contract/test-create-domain`, `test-create-data`, `test-create-presentation`, `test-update`: replaced `§ 10.x` references with canonical `## Heading` Grep pointers
- `lib/platforms/web/skills/test-create-mock`, `pres-wire-di`, `pres-create-server-action`, `data-create-db-datasource`, `data-create-db-repository`: replaced `§ N.N` references across `testing.md`, `di.md`, `server-actions.md`, and `database.md`

Zero `§` section references remain anywhere in `lib/` — all 29 web skills now use canonical `## Heading` Grep pointers, consistent with iOS and Flutter (fixed in v3.21.0)

---

## [3.23.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/data.md`: canonical template for the Data layer — platform-agnostic definitions for DTO, Mapper, DataSource, RepositoryImpl, creation order (remote + local), and layer invariants
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/presentation.md`: canonical template for the Presentation layer — StateHolder, State, Events/Input, Actions/Output, StateHolder contract shape, creation order, and layer invariants
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/ui.md`: canonical template for the UI layer — Screen, Component/Sub-view, Navigator/Coordinator, DI wiring, creation order, and layer invariants
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/di.md`: canonical template for Dependency Injection — five universal DI principles, registration order, scope rules (singleton/feature-scoped/transient), and testing with DI
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/testing.md`: canonical template for Testing — test pyramid, what to test per layer, Repository Tests, Mapper Tests, mock-vs-real decision rule, and test naming convention
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/error-handling.md`: canonical template for Error Handling — error flow diagram, error types per layer, error mapping table (HTTP → DomainError), error UI patterns, and layer invariants

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/data-worker.md`: "Data Layer Rules" now points to `reference/clean-arch/data.md` (concepts) and `reference/contract/data.md` (platform syntax); replaced stale `layer-contracts.md § Data Layer` reference
- `lib/core/agents/builder/presentation-worker.md`: removed inline StateHolder concept block (moved to `presentation.md`); "Presentation Layer Rules" now points to `reference/clean-arch/presentation.md` and `reference/contract/presentation.md`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/ui-worker.md`: "UI Layer Rules" now points to `reference/clean-arch/ui.md` and `reference/contract/presentation.md`; replaced stale `layer-contracts.md § UI Layer` reference
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/layer-contracts.md`: Data, Presentation, and UI Layer sections slimmed to pointer + summary table — full definitions now live in per-layer canonical templates
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/contract-schema.md`: "Currently available" list updated — `data.md`, `presentation.md`, `ui.md`, `di.md`, `testing.md`, `error-handling.md` added
- `lib/platforms/{web,ios,flutter}/reference/contract/data.md`: `> Concepts: reference/clean-arch/data.md` pointer header added to all three platforms
- `lib/platforms/{web,ios,flutter}/reference/contract/presentation.md`: `> Concepts: reference/clean-arch/presentation.md` pointer header added to all three platforms
- `lib/platforms/{web,ios,flutter}/reference/contract/di.md`: `> Concepts: reference/clean-arch/di.md` pointer header added to all three platforms
- `lib/platforms/{web,ios,flutter}/reference/contract/testing.md`: `> Concepts: reference/clean-arch/testing.md` pointer header added to all three platforms
- `lib/platforms/{web,ios,flutter}/reference/contract/error-handling.md`: `> Concepts: reference/clean-arch/error-handling.md` pointer header added to all three platforms

### Fixed
- `lib/platforms/web/skills/contract/domain-create-entity`, `domain-create-repository`, `domain-create-usecase`, `domain-create-service`, `domain-update-usecase`: replaced legacy `§ N.N` section references with canonical `## Heading` Grep pointers — aligns with v3.21.0 convention (iOS and Flutter were already clean)

---

## [3.22.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/domain.md`: first per-layer canonical template — platform-agnostic concept definitions for Entity, Repository, UseCase, DomainService, DomainError, creation order, and dependency rule; workers reference this for the "what"; platform contract files implement the "how"

### Changed
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/contract-schema.md`: core templates note added — documents that each contract file has a platform-agnostic counterpart in `clean-arch/`; `domain.md` listed as first available
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/layer-contracts.md`: Domain Layer section slimmed to summary table + pointer to `clean-arch/domain.md`; full definitions now live in the canonical template
- `lib/platforms/{web,ios,flutter}/reference/contract/domain.md`: stripped to syntax and platform-specific patterns only; generic concept intros and duplicate rule paragraphs removed; `> Concepts: reference/clean-arch/domain.md` header added to each file; canonical `##` headings preserved
- `lib/core/agents/builder/domain-worker.md`: "Domain Layer Rules" now points to `reference/clean-arch/domain.md` (concepts) and `reference/contract/domain.md` (platform syntax); source paths replaced with downstream paths
- `lib/core/agents/builder/{data-worker,presentation-worker,ui-worker,feature-planner}.md`: `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/layer-contracts.md` source paths replaced with `reference/clean-arch/layer-contracts.md` downstream paths
- **`scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`, `scripts/local-setup-symlinks.sh`**: `link_reference` / `copy_reference` generalized — now loop all subdirs and preserve each as a subdir in `.claude/reference/`; previously only `contract/` was handled explicitly; core call updated from `lib/core/reference/clean-arch` to `lib/core/reference` so `clean-arch/` lands at `.claude/reference/clean-arch/` downstream
- `docs/core-design-principles.md` v39, `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md` v18: reference knowledge tier structure documented — `clean-arch/` two-kind distinction (universal theory + layer templates), reference subdir rule, downstream path convention

---

## [3.21.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/contract-schema.md`: canonical keyword registry for all 8 contract reference files — defines required `##` headings per file; enforced by `arch-check-conventions`
- `error-handling.md` and `utilities.md` added to `lib/platforms/{flutter,ios,web}/reference/contract/` — contract now has 8 mandatory files on every platform

### Changed
- **Contract heading structure normalized** across all 24 contract files (8 files × 3 platforms): `#` platform+topic title, `##` canonical keyword sections (agent-greppable), `###` subsections — agents grep with `^## Keyword` for deterministic lookup without depth guessing
- **`§N` section references removed** from all 37 skills (iOS + Flutter) — replaced with canonical `## Heading` names; agents no longer grep for numbered anchors that don't exist in the files
- **Numbered headings stripped** from all non-contract reference files: web (modular, ssr, server-actions, api-routes, database, project, project-setup, overview) and iOS (project, migration, error-utilities, core-services) and Flutter (project) — `## 12. Project Structure` → `## Project Structure`
- iOS `domain.md`: removed 113-line Overview + Architecture Layers intro sections (moved concept to `project.md`); file now opens directly with `## Entities`
- iOS reference file H1 titles normalized: `# Talenta iOS — Architecture V2: N. Topic` → `# iOS — Topic`; web files (non-contract) gain `# Web — Topic` H1 where missing
- `arch-check-conventions` SKILL: contract schema check updated to grep `^## .*keyword` — `###` depth no longer satisfies the canonical keyword requirement
- `docs/core-design-principles.md` v38, `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md` v17: contract file count updated (6 → 8), heading structure rule documented

## [3.20.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- `lib/core/skills/plan/SKILL.md`: new `/plan` user-invocable skill — direct entry point to `feature-planner` agent; closes the gap where the planner was only reachable via hook and never actually invoked
- All workers (`domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `ui-worker`, `test-worker`): `## Input` section — required parameter table with `MISSING INPUT` STOP condition on entry
- All workers: `## Scope Boundary` section — declares owned layer and delegation table for out-of-scope tasks; workers STOP and name the correct worker rather than crossing layer boundaries
- All workers: `## Task Assessment` section — standardised skill-vs-direct-edit decision gate; workers default to direct `Read`+`Edit` for scoped changes and only invoke skills for new artifacts or contract changes
- All workers: `## Skill Execution` section — explicit platform path resolution (`lib/platforms/<platform>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`), Read SKILL.md, follow as authoritative procedure
- All workers: `## Output` verification — Glob + Grep each artifact before listing path; workers never return paths that don't exist on disk
- All orchestrators (`feature-orchestrator`, `backend-orchestrator`, `pres-orchestrator`): explicit output validation after each worker spawn — STOP if `## Output` section missing or any listed path does not exist on disk

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/domain-worker.md`, `data-worker.md`, `test-worker.md`: model upgraded from `haiku` to `sonnet` — skill execution requires architectural judgment (path resolution, multi-step instruction following, output verification), not purely mechanical template filling
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`, `backend-orchestrator.md`, `pres-orchestrator.md`: `platform` parameter added to Phase 0 intake and all worker spawn calls — workers now resolve skill paths deterministically at runtime
- `lib/core/agents/builder/pres-orchestrator.md`, `backend-orchestrator.md`: removed `isolation: worktree` — both orchestrators need shared working tree so uncommitted artifacts (contract file, domain artifacts) are readable across phases
- `lib/core/agents/builder/pres-orchestrator.md`: Phase 3 "Verify Wiring" removed — presentation-layer wiring knowledge moved to `ui-worker` Workflow step 6 where it belongs
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: added post-selection dispatch instructions — hook now tells the agent exactly which agent to invoke per option (`feature-planner`, `feature-orchestrator`, or inline bypass)
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: v36 — P8 orchestrator contract updated (platform param, output validation gate, worktree exception); P10 fail-fast restructured into four explicit gates; P15 convention table updated (sonnet default, new required worker sections)
- `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md`: v15 — Decision 3 runtime platform param; Decision 8a sonnet for all workers; Decision 8b worktree isolation conditional; Convention Compliance table updated

## [3.19.0] — 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- `lib/core/agents/perf-worker.md` D6: split rules into always-required and conditional — issue tracking and PR creation checks are only applied when the project's CLAUDE.md references an issue workflow; projects without issue tracking are not penalised
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: added Path Verification rule — paths must be taken verbatim from Grep output, never inferred from naming conventions
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: added Callsite Analysis rule — use `Grep --context=5` for symbol/flag impact discovery instead of per-file Read calls; reduces read:grep ratio and token overhead

---

## [3.18.0] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: block message now outputs the exact `AskUserQuestion` parameter structure (with `questions`, `header`, `options[].label`, `options[].description`) — prose-only instructions caused Claude to fall back to free-text instead of a structured choice dialog
- `lib/core/agents/perf-worker.md` D3: added work-nature classification step before skill-to-artifact alignment — flag/dead-code removal and file deletion now score N/A (8/10) automatically; skill requirements apply only to creation, restoration, and update work; mixed sessions evaluated per-portion

### Added
- `evaluation/09-d3-skill-scoring-and-hook-ask-user-question.md`: documents both fixes — root cause, changes made, and open questions for follow-up

---

## [3.17.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-planner.md`: New read-only planning agent — produces a reviewable `plan.md` per layer before any code is written; reads `layer-contracts.md` + Explore agent for existing conventions; does not set `delegation.json`; consumed by `feature-orchestrator` pre-flight on approval
- `lib/core/reference/clean-arch/layer-contracts.md`: Single source of truth for all four Clean Architecture layers — artifact types, creation order, inter-layer dependencies, and invariants; replaces inline rule lists in workers
- `lib/core/reference/README.md`: Grep-optimized taxonomy doc for agents — placement rules for reference vs agent body vs skills, directory map, access rules

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator`: Added Approved Plan Check pre-flight — detects `status: approved` in `plan.md` and skips Phase 0 if found
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: Block now surfaces three options — "Plan first with feature-planner", "Delegate to feature-orchestrator", "Proceed inline"
- `lib/core/agents/builder/domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `ui-worker`: Layer rules sections replaced with pointer lines to `layer-contracts.md`
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: P7 placement decision rule added (reference vs agent body vs skills); `feature-planner` added to Combined Matrix; builder orchestrator count updated to 5; version v35
- `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md`: `reference/README.md` and `layer-contracts.md` added to reference docs section
- `docs/stakeholder-brief.md`: New "How the Team Is Built" section — personas, orchestrators, workers, skills, and three-tier knowledge taxonomy with placement column

---

## [3.16.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `agents/scaffold-worker`: Consultant-first internal agent — gathers 4 signals (trigger, scope, platform, branching) before classifying and scaffolding any component type (skill, worker, orchestrator, new persona)
- `docs/stakeholder-brief.md`: Non-technical stakeholder brief for software-dev-agentic — mobile-first framing (iOS, Flutter, Android), includes Leave Request walkthrough and real performance data

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator`: Phase 3 now spawns `pres-orchestrator` as sub-orchestrator instead of calling `presentation-worker` and `ui-worker` directly
- `lib/core/agents/builder/pres-orchestrator`: Promoted to sub-orchestrator of `feature-orchestrator`; dual-mode (standalone vs sub-orchestrator), path-only handoff to `ui-worker`, state file writes, Search Protocol section added
- `lib/core/agents/builder/backend-orchestrator`: State file writes added after Phase 1 and Phase 2
- `lib/core/agents/detective/prompt-debug-worker`: `## Output` section added
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: Full taxonomy section added — Agents by Role/Scope, Persona definition, Skills by Type (A/B/T/U) and Scope (Toolkit/Platform-contract/Platform-only/Project/Repo), Type × Scope intersection matrix; pres-orchestrator hierarchy reflected in Combined Matrix

---

## [3.15.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- `lib/core/agents/detective/prompt-debug-worker`: New worker that diagnoses why an agent underperformed — feeds its system prompt and perf-worker trajectory back to Claude to surface ambiguous instructions, missing context, and contradicting rules
- `docs/core-design-principles.md`: Full Core Design Principles doc (v31) — local source of truth, replaces agent-architecture.md; Confluence is now the published view
- `docs/shared-submodule-arch.md`: Full Shared Submodule Architecture doc (v14) — local source of truth
- `docs/README.md`: Index of docs/ with Confluence links and edit workflow

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/perf-worker`: New Step 5 — when any D1–D7 dimension scores below 7, report flags the underperforming agent file and points to `prompt-debug-worker`
- `skills/arch-check-conventions`: Prompt Clarity Check category added (Warning) — flags ambiguous scope, missing stop conditions, contradicting rules, undefined failure paths
- `CLAUDE.md`: Trimmed from 1.1k to ~550 tokens — structure tree replaced with pointer to docs/; frontmatter examples condensed to prose

### Removed
- `docs/agent-architecture.md`: Superseded by `docs/core-design-principles.md`

---

## [3.14.0] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- `require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: Branch guard widened from `feat/*`/`feature/*` allowlist to "not main or develop" blocklist — `fix/*` and all other work branches now correctly require feature-orchestrator delegation before editing feature directories

### Added
- `evaluation/08-fix-branch-delegation-guard-gap.md`: Documents the fix branch delegation gap found in xpnsio sessions #91 and #93 (both scored Fair due to inline edits on `fix/*` branches)
- `evaluation/README.md`: Backfilled entries 07 and 08 in the log table

---

## [3.13.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- `ui-worker`: Component Reuse Check protocol — Grep existing shared components before creating new ones; gates create vs. reuse vs. extend decision
- `reference/presentation.md` (iOS, web, Flutter): `Shared Component Paths` section with platform-specific search paths for component reuse discovery
- `feature-orchestrator`: Explore Agent Grep-first rule — when spawning Explore agents, must include explicit Grep-first instructions and return structured path list
- `CLAUDE-template.md` (web): Agent Spawning Rules section with Explore Grep-first guidance
- `CLAUDE-template.md` (web): Known Configurations section documenting Tailwind v4 `@source` directive fix

### Changed
- `feature-orchestrator`: Replaced single-line inline-write constraint with prominent `ZERO INLINE WORK` block — no Edit, Write, or file-writing Bash calls, regardless of scope
- `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `ui-worker`: Added read-once rule to Search Protocol — read a file once, form a complete edit plan, apply in a single Edit call

---

## [3.12.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- `lib/platforms/flutter/`: full Flutter platform implementation — Clean Architecture + BLoC
  - `reference/`: 8 project-agnostic knowledge docs (domain, data, presentation, di, testing, navigation, project, error-handling)
  - `skills/`: 19 platform skills for core workers (domain, data, presentation, test layers)
  - `CLAUDE-template.md`: downstream CLAUDE.md snippet
- `docs/agent-architecture.md`: three-layer model doc (orchestrators → workers → skills) explaining when to use core vs platform workers

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md`: added `## Agent Architecture` pointer to `docs/agent-architecture.md`; fixed misleading `web/agents/` comment; marked flutter as active

---

## [3.11.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- `scripts/manage-packages.sh`: interactive package and hook manager for submodule projects — shows ✓/✗ state for all packages and hooks, toggle by number mid-run
- `scripts/local-manage-packages.sh`: same interactive manager for non-submodule (local copy) projects — takes `--project=` arg, uses `cp` instead of symlinks

### Changed
- `scripts/setup-packages.sh`: hooks now installed as symlinks (previously copied) — hook updates in the submodule propagate automatically; re-running migrates stale copies to symlinks with `migrate` label
- `scripts/local-setup-packages.sh`: hooks always overwritten on re-run (previously skipped) — re-running is now the upgrade path for hook changes
- All hooks (`require-feature-orchestrator.sh`, `block-impl-import-in-presentation.sh`, `lint-on-edit.sh`, `check-use-server.sh`): added disable guard — exits 0 immediately if the hook name is listed in `.claude/config/disabled-hooks`, enabling per-hook toggle without modifying `settings.local.json`

---

## [3.10.1] — 2026-04-16

### Changed
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: added `AskUserQuestion` to tools; added "Pre-flight — Resume Check" section — detects existing `state.json` runs and presents a `AskUserQuestion` dialog (Resume / Start new feature) before gathering intent
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: updated block output to instruct Claude to use `AskUserQuestion` for the delegation choice dialog instead of rendering a plain text menu

---

## [3.10.0] — 2026-04-16

### Changed
- `.claude/config/feature-dirs` — `feature-dirs` moved from `.claude/` root into `.claude/config/` to establish a dedicated directory for committed, machine-readable orchestrator config (separate from asset dirs and gitignored `agentic-state/`)
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: updated config path to `.claude/config/feature-dirs`
- All setup/sync scripts (`setup-symlinks.sh`, `setup-packages.sh`, `sync.sh`, `local-sync.sh`, `local-setup-symlinks.sh`, `local-setup-packages.sh`): updated to create `$CLAUDE_DIR/config/`, write/read `config/feature-dirs`, and auto-migrate from `.claude/feature-dirs` if found (smooth v3.9.x → v3.10.x upgrade)
- `lib/core/skills/doctor/SKILL.md`: updated check 6 path to `.claude/config/feature-dirs`

---

## [3.9.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- `.claude/feature-dirs` — new plain-text config file (one path fragment per line, `#` comments) that replaces the `## Feature Directories` fenced block in `CLAUDE.md` as the authoritative config for the delegation guard hook
- `scripts/local-setup-symlinks.sh` — non-submodule counterpart to `setup-symlinks.sh`; copies all agents/skills/reference/hooks into a local project, accepts `--platform` and `--project` args, re-running is safe
- `scripts/local-setup-packages.sh` — non-submodule counterpart to `setup-packages.sh`; interactive package picker with copy semantics, accepts `--platform` and `--project` args

### Changed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: reads feature directories from `.claude/feature-dirs` instead of parsing `## Feature Directories` fenced block in `CLAUDE.md` — simpler grep, no Python regex on markdown
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: added session boundary detection (session_id tracking) previously only present in the iOS hook — new sessions now wipe stale delegation entries immediately rather than waiting for the 4h TTL
- `lib/platforms/ios/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: removed — now identical to core hook after session boundary and `delegation.json` changes; iOS projects fall through to core hook automatically
- `agentic-state/.delegated-<branch-slug>` files replaced by a single `agentic-state/delegation.json` — branch-slug → Unix timestamp entries, atomic writes via `os.replace`; session boundary cleanup clears the JSON object instead of globbing flag files
- Block message in `require-feature-orchestrator.sh` restructured to present numbered choices `[1] Delegate` / `[2] Proceed inline` so Claude surfaces a menu to the user instead of a free-form ask
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`, `scripts/setup-packages.sh`: `settings.local.json` now patched (add `require-feature-orchestrator` hook) when file already exists, instead of skipping — mirrors `sync.sh` behaviour
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`, `scripts/setup-packages.sh`, `scripts/sync.sh`, `scripts/local-sync.sh`: create/migrate `.claude/feature-dirs` during setup; migrate from `## Feature Directories` in `CLAUDE.md` if present, else write platform default (`src` for web, `[AppName]/*` for iOS)
- `lib/platforms/web/CLAUDE-template.md`, `lib/platforms/ios/CLAUDE-template.md`: `## Feature Directories` section removed — configuration now lives in `.claude/feature-dirs`
- `lib/core/skills/doctor/SKILL.md`: added check 6 — validates `.claude/feature-dirs` exists, has at least one active fragment, and has no unfilled `[AppName]` placeholder

### Fixed
- `scripts/local-sync.sh`: feature-dirs migration now runs before the CLAUDE.md managed-block sync step, which removes `## Feature Directories` from the block; previously migration always missed it
- `scripts/local-sync.sh`: `copy_agents`, `copy_skills`, `copy_reference` now unlink broken or stale symlinks before copying — `cp -f` fails silently when the destination is a broken symlink (e.g. old submodule path that no longer resolves)

---

## [3.8.2] — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Consolidated agentic runtime state into `.claude/agentic-state/` — delegation flags (`.delegated-*`), session file (`.session-id`), and run artifacts (`runs/`) moved from `.claude/` root into a single subdirectory
- All scripts (`setup-packages.sh`, `setup-symlinks.sh`, `sync.sh`, `local-sync.sh`): mkdir now creates `agentic-state/runs/`; gitignore patch now adds `.claude/agentic-state/` as a single entry
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`, `lib/platforms/ios/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: updated FLAG_FILE and SESSION_FILE paths to `agentic-state/`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: delegation flag and run state paths updated to `agentic-state/`
- `lib/core/agents/builder/presentation-worker.md`: stateholder contract path updated to `agentic-state/runs/`
- `lib/core/skills/clear-runs/SKILL.md`: all paths updated to `agentic-state/runs/`
- `README.md`: gitignore recommendation simplified to single `.claude/agentic-state/` entry

---

## [3.8.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `scripts/local-sync.sh`, `sync.sh`, `setup-symlinks.sh`: gitignore patch now includes `.claude/.session-id` and `.claude/runs/` alongside `.delegated-*`, matching `setup-packages.sh`

---

## [3.8.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- `scripts/local-sync.sh`: new internal script to sync agents/skills/reference/hooks into projects that do not use the submodule pattern — copies files instead of symlinking, accepts `--platform` and `--project` args, all other behaviour identical to `sync.sh`

### Changed
- `perf-worker.md` D2 (Worker Invocation): added layer-to-worker mapping table, cross-layer ordering checks (domain → data → presentation → UI), and input quality check (orchestrator must pass file paths, not contents)
- `perf-worker.md` D3 (Skill Execution): added skill-to-artifact alignment tables for domain/data/presentation layers, direct-write detection (worker bypassing skills), and intra-layer skill sequencing checks

### Removed
- `isolation: worktree` from `feature-orchestrator` worker spawns and CLAUDE-template delegation rule — worktrees required a manual `git pull` after every run and `.claude/worktrees` cleanup; changes now land directly in the current branch

---

## [3.7.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- `lib/core/skills/clear-runs/`: new core skill for clearing `.claude/runs/` artifacts
- `lib/platforms/ios/hooks/`: platform-specific iOS delegation guard hook

### Changed
- `feature-orchestrator`: added Search Protocol — forbids direct `Read` on production source files; orchestrator must remain a pure coordinator and delegate all source investigation to workers
- `CLAUDE-template` (ios + web): delegation rule now requires `isolation: worktree` when invoking `feature-orchestrator`, preventing partial edits from polluting the working tree on failure
- `setup-packages.sh`: improved hook installation (copy with chmod) and extended `.gitignore` patching to include `.session-id` and `runs/`
- `packages/core.pkg`: added `clear-runs` to the default core skill set

---

## [3.6.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- `lib/core/agents/perf-worker.md`: standardized `## Effort vs Billing` section in every report — token cost breakdown (USD), per-task token distribution with ✅/❌/⚠️ productivity flags, effort-to-value ratio per deliverable, and key insight paragraph
- `perf-report/talenta-2026-04-14-att-offline-disabled-refactor.md`: agentic performance report for TE-14350 att offline disabled refactor session

---

## [3.5.1] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: branch check now matches both `feat/*` and `feature/*` — iOS projects using `feature/` prefix were silently bypassing the delegation guard
- `lib/core/agents/tracker/issue-worker.md`: feature branch prefix documented as `feat/` or `feature/` — agent now checks existing branches to follow the project convention

---

## [3.5.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- Candidate file uploads now organized into nested Google Drive folders using the pattern `{Job Title}/{timestamp} {Candidate Name}/` for easier browsing and per-applicant isolation

---

## [3.4.7] — 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: block message now explicitly instructs the agent to stop and surface to the user — removes the two-option menu that agents could self-resolve autonomously
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: `isolation: worktree` moved inline with each `Spawn <worker>` directive (Phases 1–4) so it cannot be overlooked
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: added constraint prohibiting direct `Edit`/`Write` calls from the parent session after the delegation flag is set

---

## [3.4.6] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: delegation flag now expires after 4h — stale flags are treated as missing, preventing indefinite hook bypass on interrupted orchestrator sessions
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: write epoch timestamp into delegation flag (`date +%s`) instead of empty `touch` to support TTL check
- `lib/core/agents/builder/pres-orchestrator.md`: replace full-file Read of UseCase files with targeted Grep for class/struct definitions and `execute` signatures; only Read if Grep returns no results

---

## [3.4.5] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `lib/platforms/ios/CLAUDE-template.md`: add same delegation guard rule as web — if hook blocks an edit, ask the user inline vs `feature-orchestrator`, never resolve autonomously

---

## [3.4.4] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `lib/platforms/web/CLAUDE-template.md`: add session-start rule — if delegation guard hook blocks an edit, always ask the user inline vs `feature-orchestrator`, never resolve autonomously

---

## [3.4.3] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: on block, instruct Claude to ask the user whether to proceed inline (create delegation flag) or invoke `feature-orchestrator` — replaces the static "invoke feature-orchestrator" message

---

## [3.4.2] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: actually set executable bit on disk before staging — v3.4.1 release commit used `git add` after `git update-index --chmod=+x`, which overwrote the mode back to `100644` from disk; fix re-applies `chmod +x` on the file itself

---

## [3.4.1] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: set executable bit (`100755`) — was committed as `100644`, causing `Permission denied` on all downstream hook invocations

---

## [3.4.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- `lib/core/hooks/require-feature-orchestrator.sh`: new `PreToolUse` hook — blocks inline `Edit`/`Write` on `feat/*` branches when the target file is in a feature directory and no branch-scoped delegation flag exists
- `lib/platforms/ios/settings-template.json`: new file wiring the delegation guard hook for iOS projects
- `lib/platforms/web/CLAUDE-template.md`, `lib/platforms/ios/CLAUDE-template.md`: `## Feature Directories` section — hook reads path fragments from here; iOS template uses `[AppName]` placeholder
- `setup-packages.sh`, `setup-symlinks.sh`: `--app-name=` flag + interactive prompt to replace `[AppName]` in CLAUDE.md at setup time
- `setup-symlinks.sh`: core hooks (`lib/core/hooks/`) now linked alongside platform hooks
- `README.md`: `.gitignore` recommendations section — documents `.claude/.delegated-*` pattern

### Changed
- `lib/platforms/web/settings-template.json`: `require-feature-orchestrator.sh` added as first `PreToolUse` hook
- `lib/core/agents/builder/feature-orchestrator.md`: added `Bash` to tools; Pre-flight phase sets branch-scoped delegation flag (`.claude/.delegated-<branch>`); Phase 5 clears it
- Delegation flag is now branch-scoped (`.claude/.delegated-<branch>`) — persists across sessions on the same branch, eliminating false blocks on continuation sessions

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `README.md`: rewritten for two setup personas (new project vs. existing project) — removed AI agent setup instructions, seed file manifest, and stack tables that belong in reference docs
- `web/CLAUDE-template.md`: added mandatory feature routing rule — feature work (create or update, any scope) must always delegate to `feature-orchestrator`, never inline
- `ios/CLAUDE-template.md`: same mandatory routing rule added for iOS platform

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `feature-orchestrator`: description now includes `update`, `modify`, `extend` — routes correctly when updating an existing feature (D2 fix)
- `feature-orchestrator`: Phase 0 adds "New or update?" question — update sessions only run workers for changed layers
- `feature-orchestrator`: Phase 5 renamed to "Wrap Up" — now runs `gh pr create` if no open PR exists (D6 fix)
- `perf-worker`: filename convention now includes first 8 chars of `session_id` between date and description — prevents collisions when project, date, and description are identical

### Added
- All builder workers (`domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`): `## Validation Protocol` — run type checker once, fix in one pass, confirm clean, never loop more than twice (D7 fix)
- `evaluation/03-worker-routing-and-validation.md` — documents findings and fixes from the 2026-04-13 xpnsio session

---

## [3.1.0] — 2026-04-13

### Changed
- All workers: `## Search Rules` replaced with `## Search Protocol` decision gate table — agents must answer "full file or symbol?" before any Read call (P7 enforcement)
- All builder workers: `## Output` section added as a required contract — one path per line, no prose
- `feature-orchestrator`: writes `.claude/runs/<feature>/state.json` after each phase for mid-run resumability (P4)
- `presentation-worker`: writes StateHolder contract to `.claude/runs/<feature>/stateholder-contract.md`; returns only the path (P8 fix)
- `feature-orchestrator`: passes only the contract file path to `ui-worker` — not content (P8 fix)

### Added
- `evaluation/02-context-efficiency-round-2.md` — investigation documenting xpnsio session findings and the four fixes applied

---

## [3.0.2] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh` — hooks were never symlinked into `.claude/hooks/`; script now creates the directory and links each `.sh` file

---

## [3.0.1] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- `lib/platforms/ios/skills/test-fix/` — stale reference `testing-patterns.md` → `testing-patterns-advanced.md`
- `lib/platforms/ios/skills/migrate-usecase/` — stale reference `domain-layer.md` → `domain.md`

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-12

### Changed
- **`core/` and `platforms/` moved into `lib/`** — all distributable content now lives under `lib/core/` and `lib/platforms/`. **Breaking**: downstream projects must re-run `setup-symlinks.sh` or `setup-packages.sh` after updating the submodule pointer.
- `scripts/setup-symlinks.sh`, `setup-packages.sh`, `sync.sh` — all path references updated to `lib/core/` and `lib/platforms/`
- All agents and skills with path references updated (`arch-review-orchestrator`, `arch-review-worker`, `setup-worker`, `setup-nextjs-project`, `setup-ios-project`, `arch-check-conventions`, `docs-identify-changes`)
- `CLAUDE.md` structure updated to reflect `lib/` layout

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/agents/installer/` — installer persona group: `setup-worker` (platform-agnostic project setup + onboarding)
- `platforms/ios/skills/setup-ios-project/` — iOS project setup skill (copies CLAUDE-template, prompts for placeholders, creates agents.local stub)

### Changed
- `platforms/web/skills/setup-nextjs-project/` — now `user-invocable: false`; called by `setup-worker`; orientation content removed (worker handles that); step numbering fixed; agents.local reference updated to `arch-review-worker`
- `packages/core.pkg` — `setup-worker` added to always-installed agents
- `platforms/web/CLAUDE-template.md` — `setup-worker` added to agents list
- `platforms/ios/CLAUDE-template.md` — `setup-worker` added to agents list

### Removed
- `HINTS.md` — replaced by `setup-worker` orientation output and `CLAUDE-template.md` agents list

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- `core/agents/builder/` — builder persona group: `feature-orchestrator`, `backend-orchestrator`, `pres-orchestrator`, `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker`, `ui-worker`, `test-worker`
- `core/agents/detective/` — detective persona group: `debug-orchestrator`, `debug-worker`
- `core/agents/tracker/` — tracker persona group: `issue-worker`
- `core/agents/auditor/` — auditor persona group: `arch-review-worker` (platform-agnostic)
- `packages/builder.pkg`, `packages/detective.pkg`, `packages/auditor.pkg` — selective installation via `setup-packages.sh`
- `platforms/web/skills/arch-check-web/` — web-specific CLEAN rules (W1–W6: import direction, hook exposure, ViewModel patterns, directive placement, Server Actions, Atomic Design)
- `platforms/ios/skills/arch-check-ios/` — iOS-specific CLEAN rules (I1–I4: layer imports, legacy folder violations, UseCase bypass, RepositoryImpl placement)
- `agents/arch-review-orchestrator.md` — internal convention review orchestrator (not symlinked to downstream projects)
- `agents/arch-review-worker.md` — internal convention review worker; runs `arch-check-conventions` per file
- `skills/arch-check-conventions/` — full convention checklist: frontmatter, Grep-first, isolation, model selection, platform-agnosticism, Fix F, Fix G, naming
- `skills/arch-generate-report/` — formats raw convention findings into severity-grouped report
- `agents/docs-sync-worker.md` — manual Confluence sync worker; applies targeted section updates after sessions that change structure or conventions
- `skills/docs-identify-changes/` — maps session delta descriptions to stale Confluence doc sections

### Changed
- `core/agents/` restructured from flat to persona subdirectories — **breaking**: downstream projects must re-run `setup-symlinks.sh` or `setup-packages.sh` to pick up the new paths
- `setup-packages.sh` — new Step 2: core agent group selection (builder / detective / auditor) before platform packages
- `setup-symlinks.sh` — `link_agents()` now recurses into persona subdirectories; all agents still land flat in `.claude/agents/`
- `core/agents/auditor/arch-review-worker.md` — rewritten as platform-agnostic; universal CLEAN rules U1–U5 in body; platform rules delegated to `arch-check-web` and `arch-check-ios` skills
- iOS platform skills (20 files) — corrected broken reference filenames (`domain-layer.md` → `domain.md`, `data-layer.md` → `data.md`, `testing-patterns.md` → `testing-patterns-advanced.md`); Grep-first added to all reference reads
- `platforms/ios/agents/test-orchestrator.md` — added `isolation: worktree` and `## Search Rules` section
- `platforms/ios/agents/pr-review-worker.md` — added `## Search Rules` section
- `core/agents/builder/pres-orchestrator.md` — added `isolation: worktree` to Constraints
- `core/agents/detective/debug-orchestrator.md` — added `isolation: worktree` to Constraints

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- `perf-worker` — reports now write to `web-agentic/perf-report/` (submodule) instead of downstream project's `journey/`; worker commits and pushes from inside `.claude/web-agentic/`
- `perf-worker` — report filename now follows `[project]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[short-session-description].md` pattern for cross-project readability in git log

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `agents/perf-worker.md` — agentic performance analyst; reads extracted session JSON, scores 7 dimensions (orchestration, worker invocation, skill execution, token efficiency, routing accuracy, workflow compliance, one-shot rate) with numeric scores, writes report to `journey/` and commits it
- `skills/agentic-perf-review/SKILL.md` — user-invocable `/agentic-perf-review <issue> [session_id]` slash command; extracts session data then spawns perf-worker for isolated analysis
- `scripts/extract-session.sh` — parses a Claude Code session JSONL into structured JSON (token totals, tool call frequencies, agent spawns, skill calls, duplicate reads, read:grep ratio); auto-detects current session or accepts explicit session ID
- `journey/` — serialized log of agentic design observations and improvements; entry 01 documents token optimization investigation against Core Design Principles

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- `/doctor` skill — flutter-doctor-style setup audit: checks submodule staleness, agent/skill symlinks (including broken links), CLAUDE.md managed markers, settings.local.json placeholder, and GitHub CLI auth
- `setup-packages.sh` — interactive package installer; presents a menu of packages, always installs core, lets user select orchestrator bundles (feature, backend, debug, arch-review)
- `packages/` directory with `.pkg` manifests defining agent + skill dependencies per package; orchestrator packages automatically include all dependent workers and skills

### Changed
- `CLAUDE-template.md` — added `<!-- BEGIN web-agentic -->` / `<!-- END web-agentic -->` managed section markers
- `setup-symlinks.sh` — copies `CLAUDE-template.md` → `CLAUDE.md` on first run if no CLAUDE.md exists
- `sync.sh` — replaces only the managed section in downstream `CLAUDE.md` on each sync, leaving platform-specific content untouched
- `CLAUDE.md` workflow instructions — replaced `@issue-worker` with plain `issue-worker` to avoid spurious Skill tool lookup errors

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Agent architecture**: Refactored from 5 flat agents to 2 orchestrators + 6 workers following Core Design Principles
  - `feature-scaffolder` → `feature-orchestrator` (coordinates domain/data/presentation workers)
  - `backend-scaffolder` → `backend-orchestrator` (coordinates domain/data workers for full-stack)
  - `arch-reviewer` → `arch-review-worker`
  - `test-writer` → `test-worker`
  - `debug-agent` → `debug-worker`
  - NEW: `domain-worker`, `data-worker`, `presentation-worker` (split from feature-scaffolder)
- **Skill classification**: All skills now typed as Type A (`user-invocable: false`) or Type B (`disable-model-invocation: true`) — no Type C
- **Skill naming**: Layer-prefixed convention (`domain-*`, `data-*`, `pres-*`, `test-*`)
- **Skill content**: Bodies slimmed to ~30 lines; code templates extracted to `template.md` files
- **Natural language routing**: Skills are agent-only (Type A) — users describe intent, Claude routes to the right agent
- **Extension hooks**: Every agent ends with an extension point for `.claude/agents.local/extensions/`

### Added
- `domain-create-entity`, `domain-create-usecase`, `domain-create-repository`, `domain-create-service` skills
- `data-create-mapper`, `data-create-datasource`, `data-create-repository-impl`, `data-create-db-datasource`, `data-create-db-repository` skills
- `pres-create-viewmodel`, `pres-create-view`, `pres-create-server-action`, `pres-wire-di`, `pres-ssr-check` skills
- `test-create-mock`, `test-create-domain`, `test-create-data`, `test-create-presentation` skills

### Removed
- Old flat agent files: `feature-scaffolder`, `backend-scaffolder`, `arch-reviewer`, `test-writer`, `debug-agent`
- Old skill directories: `new-entity`, `new-usecase`, `new-feature`, `new-viewmodel`, `new-server-action`, `new-db-repository`, `scaffold-repository`, `scaffold-service`, `create-mock`, `write-tests`, `integration-test`, `ssr-check`, `wire-di`

---

### Added
- Initial release of the Next.js Clean Architecture starter kit
- Architecture reference docs (`reference/`) covering domain, data, presentation, DI, testing, SSR, server actions, database, API routes, error handling, navigation, utilities, and modular structure
- Agent definitions: `feature-scaffolder`, `arch-reviewer`, `test-writer`, `debug-agent`, `backend-scaffolder`
- Skills: `new-feature`, `new-entity`, `new-usecase`, `new-viewmodel`, `write-tests`, `ssr-check`, `wire-di`, `create-mock`, `scaffold-service`, `scaffold-repository`, `integration-test`, `create-issue`, `pickup-issue`, `new-server-action`, `new-db-repository`, `setup-nextjs-project`
- Hooks: `block-impl-import-in-presentation.sh`, `lint-on-edit.sh`, `check-use-server.sh`
- `CLAUDE-template.md` for project-level Claude instructions
- `settings-template.json` with hooks pre-wired
- `README.md` with AI Project Setup flow
