You are running a post-session agentic performance review.

## Arguments

Parse the user's invocation:

```
/agentic-perf-review [issue_number] [session_id]
```

- `issue_number` — optional. A GitHub/Jira/Linear issue number this session addressed (e.g. `55`, `PROJ-42`). Omit if the project doesn't use issue tracking.
- `session_id` — optional. The Claude session UUID to analyze. If omitted, use the current (most recently active) session for this project.

## Step 1 — Capture inputs

Capture:
- `PROJECT_PATH` = current working directory (run `pwd` if needed)
- `ISSUE_REF` = the issue reference provided, or empty string if not provided
- `SESSION_ID` = provided value, or empty string if not provided

## Step 2 — Extract session data

Run the extraction script:

```bash
# With explicit session ID:
software-dev-agentic/scripts/extract-session.sh "$PROJECT_PATH" "$SESSION_ID"

# Without session ID (auto = current session):
software-dev-agentic/scripts/extract-session.sh "$PROJECT_PATH"
```

The script prints the path to the extracted JSON file (e.g. `/tmp/perf-<session_id>.json`).

If the script fails, show the error and stop.

## Step 3 — Spawn perf-worker

Spawn the `perf-worker` agent with this exact prompt (fill in the values):

```
Analyze agentic performance.

EXTRACTED_JSON: <path from step 2>
ISSUE_REF: <ISSUE_REF or empty string>
PROJECT_PATH: <PROJECT_PATH>

Follow the full perf-worker instructions to score all dimensions, write the report to docs/perf-report/, and commit it.
```

## Step 4 — Report back

When perf-worker completes, tell the user:
- The report file path
- The overall score
- The top 1–2 recommendations
